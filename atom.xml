<p><strong>Vector</strong></p>

<p>Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth that has to do with things that interest me:</p>

<ul>
<li>AI/data science</li>
<li>data in general</li>
<li>data architecture</li>
<li>streaming</li>
<li>distributed computing</li>
<li>SQL Server</li>
<li>transactions (both db as well as non db)</li>
<li>and other &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>This blog post is the &ldquo;roundup&rdquo; of the things that have been most interesting to me for the week just ending.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="databases">Databases</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/geekculture/vector-databases-taking-data-revolution-to-the-next-level-4a0faa437b2c">Vector Databases: Taking Data Revolution to The Next Level</a>. We know about SQL and no-SQL databases and how they are used, and that they are used for structured and semi-structured data. However, we now see more unstructured data, and the question is how we can deal with (search, etc.) this data. Dealing with unstructured data is where vector databases can help. This post looks at vector databases, how they can help us manage unstructured data, and the solutions they offer.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="azure-data-explorer">Azure Data Explorer</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-data-explorer-blog/azure-data-explorer-in-60-minutes-with-the-new-samples-gallery/ba-p/3447552">Azure Data Explorer in 60 minutes with the new samples gallery</a>. The post linked to announces the new Azure Data Explorer samples gallery feature. This feature provides an easy way to upskill and demo Azure Data Explorer with an end-to-end experience on a free, publicly available cluster. If you haven&rsquo;t looked at Azure Data Explorer yet, now it&rsquo;s time to do it.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-data-explorer-blog/implementing-and-optimizing-bounding-box-queries-in-azure-data/ba-p/3416786">Implementing and Optimizing Bounding Box Queries in Azure Data Explorer</a>. This post looks at how we can in Azure Data Explorer create a function that would return objects - in this case vehicles - that are within a given bounding box in a given time period. This is quite a cool usage of bounding boxes!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/10x-apache-kafka-elasticity/">Making Confluent Cloud 10x More Elastic Than Apache Kafka</a>. Elasticity is the cornerstone of cloud-native computing. This post looks at how Confluent took Apache Kafka&rsquo;s horizontal scalability to the next level—in fact, they took it up multiple levels—and made Confluent Cloud 10x more elastic! Quite interesting!</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p>This blog post is the &ldquo;roundup&rdquo; of the things that have been most interesting to me for the week just ending.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="misc">Misc.</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-manage-conda-environments-on-an-apple-silicon-m1-mac-1e29cb3bad12">How to Manage Conda Environments on an Apple Silicon M1 Mac</a>. As I mentioned in a <a href="https://nielsberglund.com/2022/04/03/interesting-stuff---week-13-2022/">previous roundup</a>, I have switched over to the &ldquo;dark side&rdquo; for my travel laptop - I did get myself a MacBook Pro. Coming from a Windows background setting it up and configuring it is sometimes a chore, so I tend to save links to blog posts/articles covering setup/configuration of a Mac. This link is such a post, and it looks at how to manage different Python environments using Conda.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.jamesserra.com/archive/2022/05/microsoft-build-event-announcements-4/">Microsoft Build event announcements</a>. Last week (May 24 - 26), Microsoft held its annual Build conference. Many interesting things were announced, and the post linked to looks at some of the data platform announcements. One &ldquo;biggie&rdquo; is that SQL Server 2022 has been released into Public Preview.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="azure-data-explorer">Azure Data Explorer</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.jamesserra.com/archive/2022/05/microsoft-build-event-announcements-4/">Deleting individual records in a table</a>. You who read my blog probably know that I like <strong>Azure Data Explorer</strong>. You also may know that my background is SQL Server. I mention my SQL Server background because sometimes doing things in ADX is somewhat different from what you&rsquo;d do in SQL Server. An example of this is deleting records. That is what this post looks at. It covers deleting individual records from a table and how it works behind the scenes.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-data-explorer-blog/optimized-autoscale-predictive-planning/ba-p/3413543">Optimized autoscale – predictive planning</a>. Azure Data Explorer has supported autoscaling (out and in) for quite some time. The autoscaling has been reactive, i.e. the scaling is delayed and requires time to alleviate the pressure off the cluster. This post looks at predictive autoscaling. It was recently added, and it tracks main metrics and builds a usage pattern. This allows ADX to plan cluster scale out and scale in ahead of time to further improve cluster performance while reducing cost.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/messaging-on-azure-blog/benchmarking-azure-event-hubs-premium-for-kafka-and-amqp/ba-p/3377483">Benchmarking Azure Event Hubs Premium for Kafka and AMQP workloads</a>. Microsoft recently announced the general availability of Azure Event Hubs Premium. It is a new product tier meant to support high-end event streaming scenarios. This post benchmarks this new product tier against Kafka, and the numbers are quite interesting. It is probably worth having a look at Azure Event Hubs Premium.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/apache-kafka-3-2-0-new-features-and-updates/">What&rsquo;s New in Apache Kafka 3.2.0</a>. The title of this post kind if gives it away. Yes, the post looks at some of the new and improved features in the 3.2 release of Apache Kafka. What is of particular interest to me is the new features in KStreams. I hope they will make way for new functionality in ksqlDB as well.</li>

<h2 id="misc">Misc.</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2022/05/12/Quamina">Meet Quamina</a>. A very interesting post by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Bray">Tim Bray</a> about <a href="https://github.com/timbray/quamina">Quamina</a>, a super fast pattern-matching library!</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.nelhage.com/post/reflections-on-performance/">Reflections on software performance</a>. In this post, the author reflects on some of the lessons learned while writing performant software and working with rather a lot more not-so-performant software. I found the conclusion of the post very interesting: <em>we underrate performance when designing and building software. We have become accustomed to casually giving up factors [of performance] of two or ten or more with our choices of tools and libraries without asking if the benefits are worth it.</em></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="azure-data-explorer">Azure Data Explorer</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/Ky52OQVwckw">Azure Digital Twins and Azure Synapse integration</a>.

<p></p>

<h2 id="misc">Misc.</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://blogs.newardassociates.com/blog/2022/mistakes-happen-get-over-it.html">Speaking Tips: Mistakes happen; get over it</a>. So, we have started having &ldquo;live&rdquo; conferences again, WoHoo! It is awesome standing in from a crowd again, presenting and demoing! The downside of presenting live is that we can&rsquo;t &ldquo;hide&rdquo; any mistakes, demos failing etc. This post by my old Developmentor colleague <a href="http://www.newardassociates.com/">Ted Neward</a> discusses handling failed demos, unexpected &ldquo;things&rdquo; happening, etc., during your presentation. If you are a speaker and concerned about failed demos, read the post. Even if you are not a speaker or concerned, go and read it anyway!</li>

<h2 id="distributed-computing">Distributed Computing</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://distributed-computing-musings.com/2022/05/vector-clocks-keeping-time-in-check/">Vector Clocks: Keeping time in check</a>. Time is essential when dealing with events, and in a one-node system, time is easy. However, time becomes problematic when dealing with time in a distributed system. This post looks at the use of vector clocks to solve the issue of causality of events occurring on different servers. Very interesting!</li>

<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/remove-kafka-brokers-from-any-cluster-the-easy-way/">How to Remove Apache Kafka Brokers the Easy Way</a>. Shrinking a Kafka cluster, i.e. removing brokers, has not been for the faint-hearted. Confluent added some functionality for removing brokers in Confluent Platform 6.0, but the process was still somewhat convoluted and error-prone. Confluent Platform 7 (and Confluent Cloud) have improved upon the process, and this blog post looks at how it works.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/kafka-summit-london-2022-recap/">Kafka Summit London 2022: The Full Recap</a>. Kafka Summit 2022 was held a week - or so - ago, and it was held live! The post linked to summarises the conference and noteworthy sessions!</li>

You who follow my blog know that I like <strong>Azure Data Explorer</strong> and what one can do with it. However, you may not know that I am also quite interested in Formula 1 (F1). So seeing the title of the linked post certainly got my interest! The post looks at how you can emulate F1 telemetry using XBox, and ingest sensor events into Azure Data Explorer for further analysis. I found it very, very cool! Now, maybe I need to get an XBox!</li>

<h2 id="data-architecture">Data Architecture</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/is-the-modern-data-warehouse-broken-1c9cbfddec3e">Is The Modern Data Warehouse Broken?</a>. When browsing, I have recently come across posts/articles debating data warehousing. The post linked to is yet another one of these. The post introduces the <em>Immutable Data Warehouse</em>, where the warehouse should represent the real world through the data.

<li><a href="https://medium.com/event-driven-utopia/unbundling-the-modern-streaming-stack-451f75eaf1d">Unbundling the Modern Streaming Stack</a>. The word <em>Modern</em> seems to be used more and more related to architecture/technologies. An example is above: the &ldquo;Modern Data Warehouse&rdquo;. Anyway, I digress; this post dissects the parts that make up the &ldquo;Modern&rdquo; Streaming stack. It compares the streaming landscape of yesteryear with what it looks like today and where it possibly can go.</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="wind-what-is-niels-doing">WIND (What Is Niels Doing)</h2>

<p>So, a couple of weeks ago, I was at the SQLBits 2022 conference, where I gave some talks. This was the first &ldquo;live&rdquo; conference since the end of January 2020 (when I did MS Ignite, The World Tour). Since then, doing conference talks from home has been the norm, and I have been using my fully &ldquo;tricked out&rdquo; development PC for the talks.</p>

<p>When going to &ldquo;live&rdquo; conferences, I used my private laptop. A couple of days before leaving for London, I decided to ensure that I had all the necessary &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; on the laptop. Imagine my shock when I realized that the laptop no longer worked; I could not get it to boot! What to do? Fortunately, I have a work laptop, so I quickly copied the necessary slide decks, code, etc., and set off to London. Unfortunately, as it is a work laptop, there is some security &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; on the laptop, which meant that some of the things I was going to do didn&rsquo;t work as expected.</p>

<p>Coming home from London, I realized that I had to get a new laptop since - hopefully - we will now do in-person conferences again. The question was then, what laptop to get. Remember, I am a Windows &ldquo;dude&rdquo;. You probably now know what I got, especially seeing the picture in <em>Figure 1</em>. Yes, I got myself a MacBook Pro M1 (14 inches, 16Gb RAM):</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/mbp-unboxed-full.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 2:</strong> <em>Ready for Setup</em></p>

<p>One week later, I have got a bit further than the setup in <em>Figure 2</em>. In fact, I am writing this post using my MBP. Expect a post or two about my experiences with the MBP in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Oh, if you wonder about the <em>The Devil Wears Skates</em> title in <em>Figure 1</em>. As a hardcore Windows guy, I have been overheard saying that I will switch to Mac when &ldquo;hell freezes over&rdquo;. I guess hell must have frozen over now, and the Devil moves along on skates.</p>

<p>For those of you who read my posts, you are probably aware that I have, the last month, been in &ldquo;prep&rdquo; mode for the <strong>SQLBits</strong> conference in London:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/sqlbits2022-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> <em>SQLBits 2022</em></p>

<p>I managed to be ready in time, and the picture above is a picture I took right before starting my full day training class on <strong>Azure Data Explorer</strong>. The notebook with <em>IT&rsquo;S POSSIBLE</em> on it, is part of the Swag I received from <a href="/derivco"><strong>Derivco</strong></a> to hand out to the delegates. Thank You, <strong>Derivco</strong>!</p>

<p>Today I am flying back to SA from London, and I think my &ldquo;prep&rdquo; paid off as the attendees seemed to like what I presented.</p>

<p>I want to give a HUGE &ldquo;shout-out&rdquo; to the organizers of <strong>SQLBits</strong>. They did a fantastic job!!! Thank You!</p>

<p>Now it is back to the &ldquo;grindstone&rdquo;, trying to develop new materials for the next conferences - whatever/wherever they are!</p>

<h2 id="finally">~ Finally</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. Please comment on this post or <a href="mailto:niels.it.berglund@gmail.com">ping</a> me if you have ideas for what to cover.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth that has to do with things that interest me:</p>

<ul>
<li>AI/data science</li>
<li>data in general</li>
<li>data architecture</li>
<li>streaming</li>
<li>distributed computing</li>
<li>SQL Server</li>

<li>and other &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>This blog-post is the &ldquo;roundup&rdquo; of the things that have been most interesting to me for the week just ending.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="big-data">Big Data</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.jamesserra.com/archive/2022/03/azure-synapse-and-delta-lake/">Azure Synapse and Delta Lake</a>. If you are using Azure for Big Data, the chances are high that you also use Azure Databrick&rsquo;s <strong>Delta Lake</strong> format. You may also use <strong>Azure Synapse</strong> for analysis, etc. This post looks at the support and interaction between Azure Synapse and Delta Lake.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="azure-data-explorer">Azure Data Explorer</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://azurecloudai.blog/2022/02/28/create-and-maintain-your-own-kql-demo-environment-with-the-new-start-for-free-cluster/">Create and Maintain Your Own KQL Demo Environment with the New Start-for-free Cluster</a>. <strong>Azure Data Explorer</strong> is the &ldquo;best thing since sliced bread&rdquo;, together with <strong>Kusto Query Language</strong> (KQL). One slight problem with learning ADX and KQL is that you&rsquo;s need to spin up an ADX cluster if you want to ingest data etc. Sure, there are help clusters around with data, but those are read-only. So, to make it easier to &ldquo;play around&rdquo; with ADX and KQL, Microsoft has just released a Start-for-free Cluster program. You can read all about it in the post linked.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2022/near-real-time-features-for-near-real-time-personalization">Near real-time features for near real-time personalization</a>. This is an exciting post by the LinkedIn engineering team. In the post, they look at LinkedIn&rsquo;s personalization recommendation journey, from pretty much batch-oriented to doing this in near real-time. Obviously Kafka plays a big part!</li>
</ul>

<p>This:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/London_calling_cover.jpg" alt="" />
<strong>Figure 1:</strong> <em>London Calling</em></p>

<p>Yay, finally! Later today I am flying out to London for <strong>SQLBits 2022</strong>, where I deliver the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://arcade.sqlbits.com/session-details/?id=300019"><strong>A Day of Azure Data Explorer</strong></a>. Full day training class.</li>

<p>There are still seats available for my training class and the conference itself. You register <a href="https://register.sqlbits.com/event/36db4730-583c-49c1-adcf-f76432bb6580/summary">here</a>!</p>

<p>A HUGE shout-out to my employer <a href="/derivco"><strong>Derivco</strong></a>, who helps with some of my costs for the trip. They also sponsor some <a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/swag"><strong>SWAG</strong></a> - another reason to come to my sessions.</p>

<p><strong>THANK YOU, Derivco</strong></p>

<p>So, if you are at <a href="https://sqlbits.com/"><strong>SQLBits</strong></a>, please come by and say Hi!</p>

This blog post is part of a series on Databricks SQL that covers critical capabilities across performance, ease of use, and governance. This post takes a closer look at the new Databricks SQL Query Profile feature and how it helps data teams speed up and optimize their queries.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ai">AI</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-goes-public-with-details-on-its-singularity-ai-infrastructure-service/">Microsoft goes public with details on its &lsquo;Singularity&rsquo; AI infrastructure service</a>. A week or so ago, it was revealed how Microsoft&rsquo;s Azure and Research teams are working together to build a new AI infrastructure service, codenamed &ldquo;Singularity&rdquo;. The post linked to looks at what this could be and looks back at previous projects with the same codename. Interesting!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/real-time-systems-what-you-need-to-know/">Building Real-Time Data Systems the Hard Way</a>. This post compares the effort of building an event-driven system based on a relational database with building it using Kafka. Since the post is from Confluent, it is obvious what is the better choice. Anyway, it is an interesting post in that it covers real-world problems we run into when wanting to develop event-driven/real-time applications.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="wind-what-is-niels-doing">WIND (What Is Niels Doing)</h2>

<p>Nothing has changed from last week, so: prepping, prepping, prepping:</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> <em>Sessions at SQLBits 2022</em></p>

<p><strong>SQLBits 2022</strong> is very close now, and I am nowhere near ready to present the sessions you see in <em>Figure 1</em>, &lt;sigh&gt;! However, somehow everything will be OK! Details of the sessions:</p>

<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/intro-to-ksqldb-sql-database-streaming/">Introducing ksqlDB</a>. The post linked to is from back in November 2019, and I must have missed it then. I came across it as I was &ldquo;researching&rdquo; ksqlDB (read browsing). The post introduces pull queries and Kafka Connect connector management from inside ksqlDB. As cool as that is, that was not what caught my eye. No, what I found interesting was the section around ksqlDB&rsquo;s internal architecture, very cool!</li>

This is an excellent post by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Bray">Tim Bray</a>, where he looks at various options for &ldquo;going to the cloud&rdquo;. As the post title implies, he also looks at the perception of lock-in and the fear thereof. As I mentioned in the beginning, this is an excellent post. Thanks to this post, I also got to an old post (from 2003) of his: <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/10/GigaTeraPeta"><em>Half a Billion Bibles</em></a>, where he puts data sizes in perspective.</li>

If you are not interested in reading the post (or the paper), Pat&rsquo;s talk based on the white paper is now up on YouTube: <a href="https://youtu.be/72UZ8DxPa8o">Decoupled Transactions: Low Tail Latency Online Transactions Atop Jittery Servers</a>. The video is very, very &ldquo;watch worthy&rdquo;!</li>

<ul>
<li>AI/data science</li>
<li>data in general</li>
<li>data architecture</li>
<li>streaming</li>
<li>distributed computing</li>
<li>SQL Server</li>

<h2 id="databases">Databases</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://cidrdb.org/cidr2022/program.html">CIDR 2022 Conference</a>. The Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research (CIDR) is a systems-oriented conference emphasizing the systems architecture perspective. CIDR 2022 was held a couple of weeks ago, and the link is to the table of content, which has links to the given talks. There are some very interesting presentations there.</li>
<li><a href="https://starrocks.medium.com/trip-com-starrocks-efficiently-supports-high-concurrent-queries-dramatically-reduces-labor-and-1e1921dd6bf8">Trip.com：StarRocks efficiently supports high concurrent queries, dramatically reduces labor and hardware cost</a>. The last few years have seen an emergence of real-time distributed OLAP datastore&rsquo;s; Druid, Apache Pinot, Clickhouse, etc. The link here is a post about StarRocks, a fairly new entry into the market. The post compares StarRocks with ClickHouse, and StarRocks comes out quite favourable.</li>

<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/real-time-data-integrations-at-scale-with-confluent-q1-22-launch/">Announcing the Confluent Q1 &lsquo;22 Launch</a>. This blog post announces new features for Confluent Cloud being launched in Q1 2022. One new &ldquo;feature&rdquo; that I like is the new Confluent CLI <code>confluent v2</code>. With <code>confluent v2</code>, I no longer need separate CLI&rsquo;s for on-prem and cloud!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/streaming-data-pipeline-with-apache-kafka-and-ksqldb/">Introduction to Streaming Data Pipelines with Apache Kafka and ksqlDB</a>. This blog post describes the elements involved in setting up a Kafka-based data pipeline: connecting data entities together; streaming data from source(s) into the middle of the pipeline; filtering, joining, and enriching the data with ksqlDB. Cool stuff!</li>

<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> <em>SQLBITS 2022 - A Day of Azure Data Explorer</em></p>

<p>Yes, I am presenting a one-day training class about Azure Data Explorer at SQLBits 2022. Referring back to what I am doing, I did a promo video for my class last evening, so go to <a href="https://youtu.be/wQwQIy_wwes"><strong>A Day of Azure Data Explorer</strong></a> and have a look. Then <a href="https://register.sqlbits.com/event/36db4730-583c-49c1-adcf-f76432bb6580/summary"><strong>register</strong></a> for <a href="https://register.sqlbits.com/event/36db4730-583c-49c1-adcf-f76432bb6580/summary"><strong>SQLBits 2022</strong></a>.</p>
