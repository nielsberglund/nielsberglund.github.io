<p>Every 6 - 9 months (or so), I clean up my development PC just to keep it &ldquo;lean and mean&rdquo;. I do it by formatting the hard-drive partition the OS (in this case, Windows) is on, followed by a new install. Recently I had a four-day weekend here in SA. Four glorious days off, a perfect time to &ldquo;nuke&rdquo; my PC and re-install!</p>

<p></p>

<p>Off I go, everything goes to plan (<a href="https://community.chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a> is my friend), and after a while, I am done (or as done as one can be). At this stage, I needed to do my <a href="/2022/06/19/interesting-stuff---week-24-2022/">weekly roundup blog post</a> for the week gone by, and as I had done some changes to the GitHub repo from my <strong>MacBook Pro</strong>, I wanted to do a <code>git pull</code> in the repo directory for my blog. Part of the story is that on my dev PC, I have all my repos on a separate partition from the system partition, so the non-system partition was un-affected by the reformat (or so I thought). Imagine my surprise when doing the <code>git pull</code> I got:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/git-unsafe-repo-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> <em>Unsafe Repository</em></p>

<p>Hmm, the error we see in <em>Figure 1</em> does not make any sense at all. It is my repo, I created it, so what is the problem?</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>Trying to narrow down the issue, I did a <code>git clone</code> into a new directory of the same repo I couldn&rsquo;t <code>pull</code>, which worked perfectly! I went over to my MacBook and did a <code>pull</code> against the same repo that failed previously, and that worked as well. By now, I was utterly dumbfounded, so I started to do proper research (read Googled), and I came across <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71901632/fatal-error-unsafe-repository-home-repon-is-owned-by-someone-else/71949648#71949648">this post</a>, which talked about security vulnerabilities in the Git client, and how they had been fixed in version <code>2.35.2</code>. When I checked my version, it was <code>2.36.1</code>, so I might be on to something here.</p>

<p>When reading about the security vulnerability in the link above, I came across this:</p>

<p><em>This version changes Git&rsquo;s behavior when looking for a top-level <code>.git</code> directory to stop when its directory traversal changes ownership from the current user.</em></p>

<p>Hmm, ownership and current user, let&rsquo;s look at the directory where the <code>pull</code> failed:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/git-unsafe-repo-owner-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 2:</strong> <em>Directory Ownership</em></p>

<p>When looking at the advanced security settings for the directory, I saw something like in <em>Figure 2</em>, a &ldquo;weird&rdquo; looking owner of the directory. Actually, it is not that weird; it is a security identifier (<code>SID</code>). A <code>SID</code> in the Windows OS identifies a user, user group, or other security principal.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> To get to the advanced security settings, I right-clicked on the directory, chose <strong>Properties</strong>, clicked on the <strong>Security</strong> tab, and in the <strong>Security</strong> tab, I clicked the <strong>Advanced</strong> button.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From what we see in <em>Figure 2</em>, it is evident that the directory owner is not the same as the current user, i.e. me. Before we look at ways to fix the issue, let&rsquo;s understand why the owner is not myself. I created the directory at one point, so the owner should be me.</p>

<p>The answer is that the directory sits on a different partition/hard drive. When I reformatted the machine, the ownership was transferred to the particular <code>SID</code> since I was not &ldquo;around&rdquo;.</p>

<p>So now we know the reason and why it happened; let&rsquo;s fix it.</p>

<h2 id="fix-the-issue">Fix the Issue</h2>

<p>The obvious way to fix the problem is to change the directory owner to me. This can be done in the <strong>Advanced Security Settings</strong> we saw before:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/git-unsafe-repo-change-owner.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 3:</strong> <em>Change Owner</em></p>

<p>In <em>Figure 3</em>, we see how it is done. I clicked the <strong>Change</strong> button (outlined in blue), which brought up the <em>Select User or Group</em> dialog. I entered my user name in the textbox (outlined in red) and then clicked <strong>OK</strong>. I am now back to being the directory owner, and when doing a <code>git pull</code>, everything works!</p>

<p>This is one way to change the owner. The problem with this is that if you have quite a few repo directories under a &ldquo;root&rdquo; directory (as I do), then it can become a bit tedious to do it: right-click directory, <strong>Properties</strong>, <strong>Security</strong>, <strong>Advanced</strong>, <strong>Change</strong> - for each directory. It would be cool if one could do something more batch-like.</p>

<p>On Windows, we have a pretty neat tool that allows taking ownership of a file or folder using the command-line interface. The tool is <code>takeown.exe</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ takeown /f . /r /d Y
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 1:</strong> <em>Take Ownership</em></p>

<p>In <em>Code Snippet 1</em>, we see how I am in the root directory of my Git repos and how I call <code>takeown</code>. The parameters are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>/f</code>: the directory or file to take ownership of. We see how I have defined <code>/f .</code>, (dot), which indicates the current directory.</li>
<li><code>/r</code>: performs a recursive operation on all files in the specified directory and subdirectories.</li>
<li><code>/d</code>: suppresses the confirmation prompt that is displayed when the current user does not have the <code>List Folder</code> permission on a specified directory and instead uses the specified default value. In my case, I used <code>Y</code>, which indicates to take ownership.</li>
</ul>

<p>Be aware that the above recurses through all directories and files, so it may take a while.</p>

<p>Another way to solve the issue, which does not involve changing ownership, is to tell Git that the directory is safe. To mark a directory safe, you use the <code>git config --global --add safe.directory &lt;option&gt;</code> command. The <code>option</code> can be a path to a directory or <code>*</code>, wherein Git treats any directory as safe.</p>

<p>When running <code>git config --global --add safe.directory</code>, the end result is that a <code>[safe]</code> section is being added to the <code>~/.gitconfig file</code>, and the section indicates what is safe:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">[user]
  email = niels.it.berglund@gmail.com
  name = Niels Berglund
[safe]
  directory = *
</code></pre>

<p>*<em>Code Snippet 2:</em> <em>Git Config File</em></p>

<p>In <em>Code Snippet 2</em> we see my <code>~/.config</code> file after I executed <code>git config --global --add safe.directory *</code>.</p>

<p>Remember that if you add a specific directory as <code>safe</code>, any changes to the directory name or path will cause the error to re-occur. However, if you add all directories as safe (or change ownership), you do not need to worry about name or path changes. It will just work.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>This post looked at what causes the <em>unsafe repository (&lsquo;some-repo&rsquo; is owned by someone else)</em> Git error. We said that this error occurs when you run a Git client with a version of <code>2.35.2</code> or higher and execute a Git command in a directory owned by someone else than the user executing the command.</p>

<p>The way to solve this is to either change the ownership of the directory/directories or mark them as safe.</p>

<p>Having re-installed Windows, it is now time to do my <strong>MacBook Pro</strong> as well. Wish me luck!</p>

As I mentioned in a <a href="https://nielsberglund.com/2022/04/03/interesting-stuff---week-13-2022/">previous roundup</a>, I have switched over to the &ldquo;dark side&rdquo; for my travel laptop - I did get myself a MacBook Pro. Coming from a Windows background setting it up and configuring it is sometimes a chore, so I tend to save links to blog posts/articles covering setup/configuration of a Mac. This link is such a post, and it looks at how to manage different Python environments using Conda.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.jamesserra.com/archive/2022/05/microsoft-build-event-announcements-4/">Microsoft Build event announcements</a>. Last week (May 24 - 26), Microsoft held its annual Build conference. Many interesting things were announced, and the post linked to looks at some of the data platform announcements. One &ldquo;biggie&rdquo; is that SQL Server 2022 has been released into Public Preview.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="azure-data-explorer">Azure Data Explorer</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.jamesserra.com/archive/2022/05/microsoft-build-event-announcements-4/">Deleting individual records in a table</a>. You who read my blog probably know that I like <strong>Azure Data Explorer</strong>. You also may know that my background is SQL Server. I mention my SQL Server background because sometimes doing things in ADX is somewhat different from what you&rsquo;d do in SQL Server. An example of this is deleting records. That is what this post looks at. It covers deleting individual records from a table and how it works behind the scenes.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-data-explorer-blog/optimized-autoscale-predictive-planning/ba-p/3413543">Optimized autoscale â€“ predictive planning</a>. Azure Data Explorer has supported autoscaling (out and in) for quite some time. The autoscaling has been reactive, i.e. the scaling is delayed and requires time to alleviate the pressure off the cluster. This post looks at predictive autoscaling. It was recently added, and it tracks main metrics and builds a usage pattern. This allows ADX to plan cluster scale out and scale in ahead of time to further improve cluster performance while reducing cost.</li>

Microsoft recently announced the general availability of Azure Event Hubs Premium. It is a new product tier meant to support high-end event streaming scenarios. This post benchmarks this new product tier against Kafka, and the numbers are quite interesting. It is probably worth having a look at Azure Event Hubs Premium.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/apache-kafka-3-2-0-new-features-and-updates/">What&rsquo;s New in Apache Kafka 3.2.0</a>. The title of this post kind if gives it away. Yes, the post looks at some of the new and improved features in the 3.2 release of Apache Kafka. What is of particular interest to me is the new features in KStreams. I hope they will make way for new functionality in ksqlDB as well.</li>

<li><a href="https://blog.nelhage.com/post/reflections-on-performance/">Reflections on software performance</a>. In this post, the author reflects on some of the lessons learned while writing performant software and working with rather a lot more not-so-performant software. I found the conclusion of the post very interesting: <em>we underrate performance when designing and building software. We have become accustomed to casually giving up factors [of performance] of two or ten or more with our choices of tools and libraries without asking if the benefits are worth it.</em></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="azure-data-explorer">Azure Data Explorer</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://blogs.newardassociates.com/blog/2022/mistakes-happen-get-over-it.html">Speaking Tips: Mistakes happen; get over it</a>. So, we have started having &ldquo;live&rdquo; conferences again, WoHoo! It is awesome standing in from a crowd again, presenting and demoing! The downside of presenting live is that we can&rsquo;t &ldquo;hide&rdquo; any mistakes, demos failing etc. This post by my old Developmentor colleague <a href="http://www.newardassociates.com/">Ted Neward</a> discusses handling failed demos, unexpected &ldquo;things&rdquo; happening, etc., during your presentation. If you are a speaker and concerned about failed demos, read the post. Even if you are not a speaker or concerned, go and read it anyway!</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://distributed-computing-musings.com/2022/05/vector-clocks-keeping-time-in-check/">Vector Clocks: Keeping time in check</a>. Time is essential when dealing with events, and in a one-node system, time is easy. However, time becomes problematic when dealing with time in a distributed system. This post looks at the use of vector clocks to solve the issue of causality of events occurring on different servers. Very interesting!</li>

<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/remove-kafka-brokers-from-any-cluster-the-easy-way/">How to Remove Apache Kafka Brokers the Easy Way</a>. Shrinking a Kafka cluster, i.e. removing brokers, has not been for the faint-hearted. Confluent added some functionality for removing brokers in Confluent Platform 6.0, but the process was still somewhat convoluted and error-prone. Confluent Platform 7 (and Confluent Cloud) have improved upon the process, and this blog post looks at how it works.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/kafka-summit-london-2022-recap/">Kafka Summit London 2022: The Full Recap</a>. Kafka Summit 2022 was held a week - or so - ago, and it was held live! The post linked to summarises the conference and noteworthy sessions!</li>

<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/real-time-data-integration-analytics-confluent-azure-synapse-connector/">Migrating Data to Azure Synapse with Confluent&rsquo;s Fully Managed Connector to Unlock Real-Time Advanced Analytics</a>. This is another really interesting post for us at Derivco, as we are underway to implement an enterprise data lake using Azure. As part of the data lake, we are looking at Azure Synapse. So, reading this post about how Confluent integrates with Azure Synapse and enables real-time data processing and advanced analytics in Azure is very cool!</li>

<p>What you see in <em>Figure 1</em> is being explained further down!</p>

<p>Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth that have to do with things that interest me:</p>

<p>This blog-post is the &ldquo;roundup&rdquo; of the things that have been most interesting to me for the week just ending.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="data">Data</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/data-engineer-tools-c7e68eed28ad">Tools For Data Engineers</a>. Data Engineers are among the most valued people in modern data-driven organisations that aim to build or enhance products by utilising their most valuable asset: data!

There is a lot of discussion on how an organization should implement its data stacks today. This article discusses some of the popular routes data solution providers are talking about in terms of types of data layers.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="azure-data-explorer">Azure Data Explorer</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-data-explorer-blog/end-to-end-azure-data-explorer-pipeline-deployment-with-arm/ba-p/3248717">End to end Azure Data Explorer pipeline deployment with ARM</a>. You, who follow my blog, know that I am doing quite a lot of Azure Data Explorer &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; now.

Expect a blog post shortly about this!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/introducing-stream-processing-use-case-recipes-for-every-industry/">Introducing Stream Processing Use Case Recipes Powered by ksqlDB</a>. ksqlDB is the &ldquo;bee&rsquo;s knees&rdquo; for real-time stream processing.

The post introduces ksqlDB &ldquo;recipes&rdquo; consisting of pre-built code samples and a step-by-step tutorial to tackle the most popular, high-impact use cases for stream processing. Awesome!!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="wind-what-is-niels-doing">WIND (What Is Niels Doing)</h2>

<p>So, a couple of weeks ago, I was at the SQLBits 2022 conference, where I gave some talks. This was the first &ldquo;live&rdquo; conference since the end of January 2020 (when I did MS Ignite, The World Tour). Since then, doing conference talks from home has been the norm, and I have been using my fully &ldquo;tricked out&rdquo; development PC for the talks.</p>

<p>When going to &ldquo;live&rdquo; conferences, I used my private laptop. A couple of days before leaving for London, I decided to ensure that I had all the necessary &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; on the laptop. Imagine my shock when I realized that the laptop no longer worked; I could not get it to boot! What to do? Fortunately, I have a work laptop, so I quickly copied the necessary slide decks, code, etc., and set off to London. Unfortunately, as it is a work laptop, there is some security &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; on the laptop, which meant that some of the things I was going to do didn&rsquo;t work as expected.</p>

<p>Coming home from London, I realized that I had to get a new laptop since - hopefully - we will now do in-person conferences again. The question was then, what laptop to get. Remember, I am a Windows &ldquo;dude&rdquo;. You probably now know what I got, especially seeing the picture in <em>Figure 1</em>. Yes, I got myself a MacBook Pro M1 (14 inches, 16Gb RAM):</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/mbp-unboxed-full.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 2:</strong> <em>Ready for Setup</em></p>

<p>One week later, I have got a bit further than the setup in <em>Figure 2</em>. In fact, I am writing this post using my MBP. Expect a post or two about my experiences with the MBP in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Oh, if you wonder about the <em>The Devil Wears Skates</em> title in <em>Figure 1</em>. As a hardcore Windows guy, I have been overheard saying that I will switch to Mac when &ldquo;hell freezes over&rdquo;. I guess hell must have frozen over now, and the Devil moves along on skates.</p>

This blog post does exactly what it says. It discusses setting up and configuring SQL Server and MS DTC to run in containers on the Kubernetes platform. I have been working with SQL Server since version 4.x (I believe it was 4.2), and a couple of years back, I would never have thought we&rsquo;d see SQL running on Linux, never mind on Kubernetes! As Bob Dylan sang, <a href="https://youtu.be/90WD_ats6eE">&ldquo;The Times They Are A-Changin&rsquo;&rdquo;</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/announcing-ksqldb-0-24-0/">Announcing ksqlDB 0.24.0</a>. Another post doing what the title says. This post looks at some of the new features in ksqlDB 0.24.0. The post also shows some examples of how to use them. I am quite interested in the ability to access record data headers from within ksqlDB. Very cool! Another interesting feature is the new functions aiding in processing JSON-formatted strings.</li>

<li>[Just enough Azure Data Explorer for data enthusiasts][3]. This LinkedIn post is an excellent overview of Azure Data Explorer. There is, however, one big flaw in the post - it should have been published a week earlier. Then I would have been able to use some of it in my Azure Data Explorer talks at SQLBits 2022. Just kidding - excellent post.</li>

<p>For those of you who read my posts, you are probably aware that I have, the last month, been in &ldquo;prep&rdquo; mode for the <strong>SQLBits</strong> conference in London:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/sqlbits2022-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> <em>SQLBits 2022</em></p>

<p>I managed to be ready in time, and the picture above is a picture I took right before starting my full day training class on <strong>Azure Data Explorer</strong>. The notebook with <em>IT&rsquo;S POSSIBLE</em> on it, is part of the Swag I received from <a href="/derivco"><strong>Derivco</strong></a> to hand out to the delegates. Thank You, <strong>Derivco</strong>!</p>

<p>Today I am flying back to SA from London, and I think my &ldquo;prep&rdquo; paid off as the attendees seemed to like what I presented.</p>

<p>I want to give a HUGE &ldquo;shout-out&rdquo; to the organizers of <strong>SQLBits</strong>. They did a fantastic job!!! Thank You!</p>

<p>Now it is back to the &ldquo;grindstone&rdquo;, trying to develop new materials for the next conferences - whatever/wherever they are!</p>

One slight problem with learning ADX and KQL is that you&rsquo;s need to spin up an ADX cluster if you want to ingest data etc. Sure, there are help clusters around with data, but those are read-only. So, to make it easier to &ldquo;play around&rdquo; with ADX and KQL, Microsoft has just released a Start-for-free Cluster program. You can read all about it in the post linked.</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/bring-your-own-monitoring-with-confluent-cloud/">Bringing Your Own Monitoring (BYOM) with Confluent Cloud</a>.

<p></p>

<h2 id="big-data">Big Data</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://databricks.com/blog/2022/02/10/databricks-delta-live-tables-announces-support-for-simplified-change-data-capture.html">Databricks Delta Live Tables Announces Support for Simplified Change Data Capture</a>. I don&rsquo;t know what category this post falls under, but Big Data sounds OK:ish, so that&rsquo;s where it ends up. Anyway, the post looks at <a href="https://databricks.com/product/delta-live-tables">Delta Live</a> table&rsquo;s support for CDC. Cool stuff!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://databricks.com/blog/2022/02/07/structured-streaming-a-year-in-review.html">Structured Streaming: A Year in Review</a>. This post gives an overview of all the new Structured Streaming features developed in 2021 for Databricks and Apache Spark. As you see, it is quite a lot!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/intro-to-ksqldb-sql-database-streaming/">Introducing ksqlDB</a>. The post linked to is from back in November 2019, and I must have missed it then. I came across it as I was &ldquo;researching&rdquo; ksqlDB (read browsing). The post introduces pull queries and Kafka Connect connector management from inside ksqlDB. As cool as that is, that was not what caught my eye. No, what I found interesting was the section around ksqlDB&rsquo;s internal architecture, very cool!</li>
</ul>
