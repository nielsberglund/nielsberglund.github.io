<li><a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2020/11/16/building-and-sharing-jupyter-books-in-azure-data-studio/">Building and sharing Jupyter Books in Azure Data Studio</a>. We all should know by now that Azure Data Studio allows us to use Jupyter notebooks. This post looks at how we can not only use Jupyter books but also create and share them. Very cool!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="distributed-computing">Distributed Computing</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/expedia-group-tech/autoscaling-in-kubernetes-a-primer-on-autoscaling-7b8f0f95a928">Autoscaling in Kubernetes: A Primer on Autoscaling</a>. This post is the first in a series looking at application autoscaling in Kubernetes. I was going to write that I really look forward to the second instalment when I realized it already had been <a href="https://medium.com/expedia-group-tech/autoscaling-in-kubernetes-options-features-and-use-cases-c8a6ce145957">published</a>! Awesome!</li>
<li><a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2020/11/18/distributed-systems-and-elliptic-curves.html">New courses on distributed systems and elliptic curve cryptography</a>. As the title says; Martin Kleppman of <a href="http://dataintensive.net/">Designing Data-Intensive Applications</a> fame have released some new training courses. I am very interested in the distributed systems course; the videos look awesome! This course is a must for anyone interested in distributed systems!</li>

<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/how-real-time-stream-processing-safely-scales-with-ksqldb/">How Real-Time Stream Processing Safely Scales with ksqlDB, Animated</a>. This post is the third in a series around ksqlDB and how it executes stateless and stateful operations. The two previous posts have looked at a single server setup. This post looks at how stateless and stateful operations work when ksqlDB is deployed with many servers, and more importantly, how it linearly scales the work it is performingâ€”even in the presence of faults.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/using-kafka-ksqldb-kibana-to-stream-data-and-get-real-time-analytics/">Analysing historical and live data with ksqlDB and Elastic Cloud</a>. This is a great post by <a href="https://twitter.com/rmoff">Robin Moffat</a>. He looks at how you can take &ldquo;messy and imperfect&rdquo; data, (think CSV), from a &ldquo;raw data&rdquo; Kafka topic, re-format it, and make it presentable with ksqlDB, push it into another topic, and from there stream it into an analytical dashboard. Awesome stuff!</li>

<p></p>

<h2 id="big-data">Big Data</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2020/11/02/helios-part-ii/">Helios: hyperscale indexing for the cloud &amp; edge (part II)</a>. In last weeks <a href="/2020/11/01/interesting-stuff---week-44-2020/">roundup</a>, I pointed to a post by <a href="https://twitter.com/adriancolyer">Adrian</a>, where he dissected a white-paper about Helios, and I said how I looked forward to part 2. Well, I got what I wanted, and the post I link to here is the follow-up. Enjoy!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="distributed-computing">Distributed Computing</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://vlfig.me/posts/microservices">Microservices â€” architecture nihilism in minimalism&rsquo;s clothes</a>. This post looks at microservices and argues that there is no such thing as a microservice architecture, but software architecture. The author also looks at the size of a microservice and argues that there is no prescribed size of a microservice. I found the post very interesting!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://itnext.io/change-data-capture-with-azure-postgresql-and-kafka-4598dbf0b57a">Change Data Capture with Azure, PostgreSQL, and Kafka</a>. In this blog post, the author looks at how one can use Change Data Capture to stream database modifications from PostgreSQL to Azure Data Explorer, (Kusto), using Apache Kafka. It is an interesting post! As a side note, I must say that Azure Data Explorer looks really interesting!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/pull-queries-in-preview-confluent-cloud-ksqdb/">Announcing Pull Queries in Preview in Confluent Cloud ksqlDB</a>. ksqlDB has two types of queries: push and pull. Push queries allow you subscribe to a query&rsquo;s result as it changes in real-time, whereas with a pull query you fetch the current state of a materialized view. Both types of queries have been in Confluent Platform for a while, but Confluent Cloud has up until now only supported push queries. That changes now, and the post I linked to here discusses more in detail about the support for pull queries in Confluent Cloud.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="wind-what-is-niels-doing">WIND (What Is Niels Doing)</h2>

<p>Well, it is not so much about what I am doing, as it is of what I have been doing the last couple of days. You who read my blog are probably aware that:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/Niels_Berglund.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> <em>SQL Server &amp; Kafka</em></p>

<p>Yes, I am speaking at the conference! My topic is about, as you can see in <em>Figure 1</em>, the various ways we can stream data from SQL Server to Apache Kafka. In a previous roundup, I wrote how I was prepping for the talk. That is all good and well, but a while ago a &ldquo;curve-ball&rdquo; was thrown: the conference is obviously virtual, but: we are not presenting live! Which means that the last few days, I have been recording, and editing the recording. Geez, recording and editing is hard work, compared to &ldquo;just&rdquo; deliver. Well, it is done now, and if you <a href="https://dataplatformgeeks.com/dps2020/booking/https://dataplatformgeeks.com/dps2020/booking/">register</a> you have the chance to see other speakers and me in a recorded fashion.</p>

In this post <a href="https://twitter.com/adriancolyer">Adrian</a> from the <a href="https://blog.acolyer.org">morning paper</a> dissects a white-paper about Helios. Helios is a distributed, highly-scalable system used at Microsoft for flexible ingestion, indexing, and aggregation of large streams of real-time data that is designed to plug into relational engines. Adrian is as thorough as usual, and the conclusions he draws are very interesting. I can&rsquo;t wait for part 2.</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@polyglot_factotum/how-i-am-learning-distributed-systems-7eb69b4b51bd">How I am learning distributed systems</a>. This post looks, from one person&rsquo;s perspective, how one can learn to design distributed systems. What is interesting in this post is the use of <a href="https://raft.github.io/">Raft</a>, (no, not Raft the game - but the consensus algorithm), as a learning tool. I will definitely point to this post as a learning resource for my developers.</li>
<li><a href="https://thenewstack.io/nginx-steps-into-the-service-mesh-fray-promising-a-simpler-alternative/">NGINX Steps into the Service Mesh Fray Promising a Simpler Alternative</a>. The post linked to here points discusses how NGINX introduces its own service mesh: <a href="https://www.nginx.com/products/nginx-service-mesh">NGINX Service Mesh</a>, (NSM). It promises to be less complicated than ISTIO, so I will definitely have a look.</li>

<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/how-to-prepare-for-kip-500-kafka-zookeeper-removal-guide/">Preparing Your Clients and Tools for KIP-500: ZooKeeper Removal from Apache Kafka</a>. The Kafka community has for quite a while been talking about removing the dependency of ZooKeeper, (ZK), from Kafka, and it seems we are getting closer. In the post I have linked to here, the author looks at what is needed to do in Kafka consumers so that nothing &ldquo;bad&rdquo; happens when ZK is eventually removed.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.kai-waehner.de/blog/2020/10/27/streaming-machine-learning-kafka-native-model-server-deployment-rpc-embedded-streams/">Streaming Machine Learning with Kafka-native Model Deployment</a>. Kafka is used more and more for real-time machine learning purposes, and we are moving towards Kafka as a native streaming model server. This blog post explores the architectures and trade-offs between various options for model deployment with Kafka.</li>

<h2 id="sql-server-2019-big-data-cluster">SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://mohammaddarab.com/stop-and-start-your-aks-big-data-cluster-and-save-money/">Stop and Start your AKS Big Data Cluster and Save $$$</a>. In this post, my good friend <a href="https://twitter.com/mwdarab">Mohammad</a> looks at new functionality in Azure Kubernetes Service, (AKS), whereby you can start and stop Kubernetes clusters at will. Mohammad looks at it from the perspective of SQL Server 2019 Big Data Clusters running in AKS.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/data-rocks/kafka-record-tracing-379ed2b0af51">Kafka record tracing</a>. Do you know how long it takes for messages to flow in your data pipeline? Do you know where the bottlenecks are? Why I ask these questions is that in a distributed system, the answers may not always be that easy to find. The post linked to here looks at solutions to these questions, and it looks at distributed tracing for Kafka.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/kafka-cluster-linking-with-confluent-platform/">Introducing Cluster Linking in Confluent Platform 6.0</a>. As the title of this post says, the post is about linking Kafka clusters to each other. From the post: &ldquo;Replicating topics between Kafka clusters has been a long-standing problem thatâ€™s seen a number of solutions, including MirrorMaker and Confluent Replicator. Although the utility of these projects has come a long way, theyâ€™re not without their respective issues.&rdquo;. The issues referred to in the previous sentence, is what the new cluster linking functionality is supposed to fix. It looks very promising, the one question I have right now is if this is a Confluent Platform Enterprise only functionality?</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/data-rocks/managing-kafka-connectors-at-scale-using-kafka-connect-manager-kcm-31d887de033c">Managing Kafka Connectors at scale using Kafka Connect Manager</a>. A while back we, (<a href="/derivco">Derivco</a>), looked at using CDC and Debezium to get data out from the database to Kafka. One of the problems we faced was how to manage the various Kafka Connectors, and ensure they were functioning correctly. The post I link to here would have been the perfect solution for us - a framework for managing Kafka Connectors. It would be interesting to know if it is open-sourced.</li>

As the title of this post says; the post is about the new 6.0 release of Confluent Platform. Reading the post, this release looks huge. There are so many interesting things in there, but the ones that stand out for me are the ksqlDB improvements! For more information about the new ksqlDB functionality, look at the post <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/ksqldb-0-12-0-features-updates/">ksqlDB 0.12.0 Introduces Real-Time Query Upgrades and Automatic Query Restarts</a>. This is awesome!</li>

While we are on the subject of ksqlDB, this post is doing a great job how ksqlDB works. If you are interested in ksqlDB at all, you must read the post!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/ksqldb-java-client-iot-inspired-demo/">ksqlDB Meets Java: An IoT-Inspired Demo of the Java Client for ksqlDB</a>. Even more ksqlDB. The post linked to here looks at the new ksqlDB Java client. So, instead of using REST API&rsquo;s, you can now do ksqlDB &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; programmatically, using this new client, That is very, very interesting!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="wind-what-is-niels-doing">WIND (What Is Niels Doing)</h2>

<p>Yes, what AM I doing? Sometimes, quite often actually, I wonder that myself. Today, however, I do know what I am doing, or more specifically, what I just did! Yesterday, (October 3), I delivered a virtual conference talk at SQLBits about SQL Server and Kafka.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the talk was pre-recorded, and after I had uploaded the recording, the organizers did some editing. I messed up with what parts of the talk needed editing, so the result was that around a third of the talk was missing. Not good! Anyway, the organizers will do a re-edit and upload so that attendees can view it on demand. If you were one of the attendees, I do apologize again!</p>

<p>Anyway, today I uploaded the slide deck as well as all code for the talk, (including instructions). If you are interested, you can download it from <a href="https://nielsberglund.com/download/set-data-free-kafka.zip">here</a>.

<li><a href="https://www.infoq.com/podcasts/urban-planning-software-architecture/">Pat Helland on Software Architecture and Urban Planning</a>. The link here is to a podcast by the legendary <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pathelland/">Pat Helland</a> where he talks about the relationship between software architecture and urban planning. Pat explores planning for future growth, regulations/standards, and communication practices that cities - and software architecture - had to evolve to use. He uses these comparisons to distil lessons that architects can use in building distributed systems.

<p>I am prepping for one of the largest data platform conferences taking place, (virtually), beginning of December this year: <a href="https://dataplatformgeeks.com/dps2020/"><strong>DATA PLATFORM VIRTUAL SUMMIT 2020</strong></a>. I hear you asking: &ldquo;why are you prepping?&rdquo;. Well, that&rsquo;s because:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/Niels_Berglund.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> <em>SQL Server &amp; Kafka</em></p>

<p>Yes, I am speaking at the conference! My topic is about, as you can see in <em>Figure 1</em>, the various ways we can stream data from SQL Server to Apache Kafka.</p>

<p>The conference has world class-speakers, (and me), so hurry up and <a href="https://dataplatformgeeks.com/dps2020/booking/">register</a>!</p>

<p>This blog-post is the &ldquo;roundup&rdquo; of the things that have been most interesting to me, for the week just ending.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="distributed-computing">Distributed Computing</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/distributed-video-sharing-demo/">Distributed Programming, Hash Tables, and Fun!</a>. In this <a href="https://www.infoq.com/">InfoQ</a> presentation, the presenters demonstrate how they built a distributed hash-table video-sharing system, the technical hurdles encountered, and the pros/cons of using functional languages to do so. Very interesting!</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://becominghuman.ai/cheat-sheets-for-ai-neural-networks-machine-learning-deep-learning-big-data-678c51b4b463">Cheat Sheets for AI, Neural Networks, Machine Learning, Deep Learning &amp; Big Data</a>. Cheat sheets are good, and I certainly need them. The post linked to gives, according to the post, <em>the most complete list of best AI cheat sheets</em>. I don&rsquo;t know about that, but there are some quite cool cheat sheets in there.</li>
<li><a href="https://dalelane.co.uk/blog/?p=4124">Using TensorFlow to make predictions from Kafka events</a>. This is a very interesting post, looking at how you can use Kafka and TensorFlow together to make machine learning predictions around sensor events.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/prioritize-messages-in-kafka/">Implementing Message Prioritization in Apache Kafka</a>. This post came at the exact right time, as I have been battling with how to implement priority messages in Kafka. In Rabbit, which we used previously, it was easy. In Kafka not so much. So reading about &ldquo;bucketing&rdquo; saved the day!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="wind-what-is-niels-doing">WIND (What Is Niels Doing)</h2>

<p>In <a href="/2020/09/06/interesting-stuff---week-36-2020/">last weeks roundup</a> I said how I was going to do a <strong>Derivco Webinar</strong> this week about <strong>SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster</strong>. Well, I did it September 10, it went off without a &ldquo;hitch&rdquo;, and - if I can say it myself - it was a lot of fun. If you are interested in seeing it, you find it on the Derivco YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyCsQP5VJhU">here</a>.</p>

There are increased regulatory demands for protecting personal/sensitive data. The blog post linked to here introduces Privitar Data Privacy Platform, and it looks at how it integrates to Confluent Platform through Privitar Kafka Connector.</li>

Initially, it was met with a healthy dose of scepticism, but after a while, the doubt died away when people saw it working. This post discusses the recent improvements on exactly-once semantics (EOS) to make it simpler to use and more resilient. We are getting there, my friends!</li>
