<p></p>

<h2 id="ai-ml">AI/ML</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.engraved.blog/building-a-virtual-machine-inside/">Building A Virtual Machine inside ChatGPT</a>. In last week&rsquo;s roundup, I mentioned ChatGPT, and here is more about its coolness. This post looks at running a virtual machine inside ChatGPT! I don&rsquo;t know about you, but to me, this is plain scary!</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/ai-homework/">AI Homework</a>. Related to ChatGPT - this post looks, among other things, at how ChatGPT works under the covers. Very interesting!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="data-architecture">Data Architecture</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.databricks.com/blog/2022/12/08/build-reliable-and-cost-effective-streaming-data-pipelines.html">Build Reliable and Cost Effective Streaming Data Pipelines With Delta Live Tables&rsquo; Enhanced Autoscaling</a>. Earlier this year, Databricks announced the general availability of Delta Live Tables (DLT). An ETL framework which introduces a simple, declarative approach to building reliable data pipelines. This post looks at a new feature of DTL: Enhanced Autoscaling for Delta Live Tables (DLT), which allows analysts and data engineers to quickly create production-ready streaming or batch data pipelines.</li>
<li><a href="https://benn.substack.com/p/how-analysis-dies">How analysis dies</a>. I found this post very thought-provoking, and I liked it a lot. So much so that I am forwarding it to other people at <a href="/derivco">Derivco</a>. However, I have difficulty summarizing it, so why don&rsquo;t you just read it yourselves ðŸ˜„!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/configuring-apache-kafka-consumer-group-ids">What Are Apache Kafka Consumer Group IDs?</a>. This an excellent post about an often misunderstood concept in Kafka: consumer groups. If you write any Kafka applications, read this post!</li>

<p>This blog post is the &ldquo;roundup&rdquo; of the things that have been most interesting to me for the week just ending.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="azure-data-explorer">Azure Data Explorer</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://xhinker.medium.com/understand-kusto-inside-out-and-why-kusto-is-so-fast-54697e6648d7">Understand Kusto Engine</a>. You, who have followed my blog for a while, know that I like <strong>Azure Data Explorer</strong> (ADX) a lot, and I write posts myself as well as linking to posts written by others. This post is something that I must have missed as it is from 2020, but still relevant. The post explains why ADX is so fast from data storage and query execution perspectives. What I like about this post is that it drills down and looks at the architecture of ADX on a fairly deep level.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ai-ml">AI/ML</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/research-focus-week-of-november-28-2022">Research Focus: Week of November 28, 2022</a>. This post from Microsoft Research links to white papers accepted for publication at NeurIPS 2022. NeurIPS is a machine learning and computational neuroscience conference.</li>
<li><a href="https://pub.towardsai.net/openai-debuts-chatgpt-50dd611278a4">ChatGPT â€” OpenAI&rsquo;s New Dialogue Model!!</a>. Anyone remotely interested in AI has probably noticed that there is a &ldquo;new kid&rdquo; on the block - <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/"><strong>ChatGPT</strong></a>. <strong>ChatGPT</strong> was trained to have interactions in a conversational way, and this post looks at some examples of what ChatGPT can do. If you want to be blown away by the capabilities of ChatGPT, log on to Twitter and search for <code>#ChatGPT</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.kai-waehner.de/blog/2022/11/29/apache-kafka-is-not-real-real-time-data-streaming/">Apache Kafka is NOT real real-time data streaming!</a>. WHAT?! Are you kidding me - what do you mean Kafka is not real-time data streaming? Joking aside, this post looks at different aspects of data streaming based on latency requirements. In conclusion, Kafka is not for you if you need microsecond latency. In those scenarios, you&rsquo;d need proprietary software. For scenarios when millisecond+ latencies are OK, Kafka is definitely for you.</li>
</ul>

<li><a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2022/11/19/AWS-Blockchain">AWS and Blockchain</a>. This is a very interesting post, looking at - as the title implies - AWS and Blockchain. The reasoning behind AWS not investing in Blockchain is eye-opening.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="databases">Databases</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/what-is-a-distributed-database/">What is a distributed database and how do they work?</a>.

</ul>

<h2 id="azure-data-explorer">Azure Data Explorer</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-data-explorer-blog/getting-started-with-open-telemetry-and-azure-data-explorer/ba-p/3675708">Getting started with Open Telemetry and Azure Data Explorer</a>. This post looks at using Open Telemetry&rsquo;s (OTel) Azure Data Explorer exporter to ingest data generated by OTel into Azure Data Explorer clusters. Very cool!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ai-ml">AI/ML</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/machine-learning-for-fraud-detection-in-streaming-services-b0b4ef3be3f6">Machine Learning for Fraud Detection in Streaming Services</a>. Netflix streaming services serve content to millions of users all over the world. Certain restrictions exist, such as the number of active devices, the number of streams, etc. Having million of users across makes for a large attack surface for fraud, and being able to detect fraud in real time is of vital importance. This post looks at some of Netflix&rsquo;s real-time fraud detection strategies.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>

This post is the first in a series looking at partitions in Kafka. In the post, the author looks at what a Kafka partition is. I recommend anyone working with Kafka to read this!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="wind-what-is-niels-doing">WIND (What Is Niels Doing)</h2>

<p>This is not so much about what I am doing as what I not have been doing ðŸ˜ž.</p>

<p>As I wrote in the <a href="/2022/11/13/interesting-stuff---week-45-2022/">last roundup</a>, I was about to fly out to Seattle and the PASS Summit. After the Summit this weekend, I would present at Azure Bootcamp South Africa.</p>

<p>During my flight to Seattle (boy, Seattle is a looong way away from Durban ðŸ˜„), I started to feel like I was coming down with a cold, and I did. It worsened during the week, and I spent most of my time in bed in my hotel. However, I managed to do my talk, and it went really well.</p>

<p>The cold did not get any better, and on Wednesday last week, I had to make the difficult decision to cancel my talks at the Bootcamp ðŸ˜¢. So, as you can understand, I am not a &ldquo;happy camper&rdquo; right now.</p>

<h2 id="data-architecture-engineering">Data Architecture / Engineering</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2016/03/16/engineers-shouldnt-write-etl">Engineers Shouldn&rsquo;t Write ETL: A Guide to Building a High Functioning Data Science Department</a>. This post is from 2016, but still very relevant, and it resonates with me due to what we are doing at <a href="/derivco">Derivco</a> right now. Without giving too much away (go and read the post), the post lays out a blueprint for building a data science team that can pivot and react quickly.</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/big-data-tools/2022/11/09/data-engineering-annotated-monthly-october-2022/">Data Engineering Annotated Monthly â€“ October 2022</a>. Quite a few interesting things in this monthly Data Engineering newsletter. What I found of particular interest: Apache Doris, the official Spark Docker image, and the article about Data Engineers and plumbers.</li>
<li><a href="https://benn.substack.com/p/day-of-reckoning">Data&rsquo;s day of reckoning</a>. First, if you are into data but not subscribing to <a href="https://benn.substack.com/">Benn&rsquo;s newsletter</a>, click on the link and go ahead and sign up. I will be waiting here&hellip; Cool, so where were we? Ah, this post essentially says: we cannot all be Netflix, Google, etc. - expect to have different data and that we should be more targeted in our ambitions.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="azure-data-explorer">Azure Data Explorer</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/five-reasons-to-dive-into-azure-data-explorer/">Five Reasons to Dive into Azure Data Explorer</a>. This post contains a link to a downloadable e-book focusing on the five reasons that make ADX a good fit for businesses. If you are interested in ADX (and you should be), download the book. In addition, come to <a href="https://azurebootcamp.co.za/">Azure BootCamp South Africa 2022</a> in two weeks and hear me talk about ADX.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="azure-functions">Azure Functions</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-sql-blog/announcing-public-preview-of-the-azure-sql-trigger-for-azure/ba-p/3674068">Announcing public preview of the Azure SQL trigger for Azure Functions</a>. Azure Functions is &ldquo;da&rsquo; bomb&rdquo;. We all know that! This post announces something that makes it even better: the ability to trigger a function from changes to a table(s) in Azure SQL DB. We have had for a while the ability to use Azure SQL Bindings to connect and write to Azure SQL DB, but this now gives us the ability to &ldquo;listen&rdquo; to changes in the database. Very cool!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2022/11/debezium-change-data-capture/">Debezium Releases Version 2.0 of Its Change Data Capture Tool</a>. At <a href="/derivco">Derivco</a>, we are looking at using Debezium for quite a few use cases. Therefore the announcement in this post comes as music to our ears.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>ksqlDB - The Real-Time Streaming Database</strong>. As the title implies, the presentation is about <strong>ksqlDB</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am flying out this evening and will be back in SA next Sunday. Then the following Saturday (November 26), I present at the <a href="https://azurebootcamp.co.za/"><strong>Azure BootCamp South Africa 2022</strong></a> in Cape Town. There I am doing two talks:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Analyze Billions of Rows of Data in Real-Time Using Azure Data Explorer</strong></li>
<li><strong>ksqlDB and Azure Serverless Functions: A Match Made in the Cloud</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This will be fun, <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/azure-bootcamp-south-africa-2022-cape-town-tickets-443949844937">registration</a> is FREE, so you have no excuse not to attend! ðŸ˜„</p>

<li><a href="https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/how-pinterest-leverages-realtime-user-actions-in-recommendation-to-boost-homefeed-engagement-volume-165ae2e8cde8">How Pinterest Leverages Realtime User Actions in Recommendation to Boost Homefeed Engagement Volume</a>. In the <a href="/2022/10/30/interesting-stuff---week-43-2022/">roundup</a> for last week, I looked at an interesting post by Pinterest, looking at how they make Pin recommendations. This post goes further and looks at real-time actions by users and how that leads to better engagement.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://datacater.io/blog/2022-02-11/etl-pipeline-with-apache-kafka.html">Building Real-Time ETL Pipelines with Apache Kafka</a>. This post provides an introduction to building real-time ETL pipelines with Apache Kafka, Apache Kafka Connect, and Apache Kafka Streams. Quite interesting!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="wind-what-is-niels-doing">WIND (What Is Niels Doing)</h2>

<p>It has probably not gone unnoticed how Elon Musk has bought Twitter and the &ldquo;saga&rdquo; following the purchase. Related to that, quite a few people are looking for alternatives to Twitter, and the choice for many seems to be <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>. Since I am a &ldquo;sucker# for trying new stuff (not that Mastodon is new - it was introduced in 2016), I just signed up. My &ldquo;handle&rdquo; is <strong>@nielsb@fosstodon.org</strong>, and the link to my profile is <a href="https://fosstodon.org/web/@nielsb">here</a>.</p>

<p>So, what else is new? Well, I am making my first USA trip since 2009, and I am speaking at the <a href="https://www.passdatacommunitysummit.com/"><strong>PASS Data Community Summit 2022</strong></a>. My session is:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>ksqlDB - The Real-Time Streaming Database</strong>. As the title implies, the presentation is about <strong>ksqlDB</strong>. I have delivered ksqlDB talks before, but this session is very much new material.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am excited! If you are around, come by and say Hi!</p>

It is an introductory course about the Kafka Schema registry. Well, the post is not the course, but it points to the course&rsquo;s individual modules. Very useful!</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2022/10/05/data-virtualization-with-polybase-for-sql-server-2022/">Data Virtualization with PolyBase for SQL Server 2022</a>. One of the big things back in the day (well, maybe a year or two ago) fro SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster (BDC) was the Polybase support for External Tables against a lot of data sources. That support has now been introduced in your &ldquo;normal&rdquo; SQL Server 2022, and this post looks at this new PolyBase and what you can do with it.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="data-architecture">Data Architecture</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/modern-data-architectures/">The InfoQ eMag: Modern Data Architectures, Pipelines, &amp; Streams</a>. This <a href="https://www.infoq.com/">InfoQ</a> post contains a download link for an eMag book: <strong>Modern Data Architectures, Pipelines, &amp; Streams</strong>.

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/apache-kafka-3-3-0-new-features-and-updates/">What&rsquo;s New in Apache Kafka 3.3</a>. I guess the title says it all. Kafka 3.3 was just released, and this post looks at some of the new features. The big one in this release is that KRaft is production ready.

<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/building-streaming-data-pipelines-visually/">Introducing Stream Designer: The Visual Builder for Streaming Data Pipelines</a>. What this post looks at is something I can&rsquo;t wait to start &ldquo;playing&rdquo; with, the <strong>Stream Designer</strong>. The Stream Designer is a visual interface for rapidly building, testing, and deploying streaming data pipelines natively on Kafka. It is of particular interest as we at <a href="/derivco">Derivco</a> are now doing some very interesting &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; related to data pipelines.</li>

<p>This blog post is the &ldquo;roundup&rdquo; of the things that have been most interesting to me for the week just ending.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="distributed-systems">Distributed Systems</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://learncsdesigns.medium.com/an-overview-of-distributed-systems-architectures-4719692f8558">An overview of distributed systems architectures</a>. This post is the second in a series on system design. I found this post really useful as an introduction. Very good! Also, look at the links at the right of the post - some excellent &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; in there!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="azure-data-explorer">Azure Data Explorer</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-data-explorer-blog/ingesting-protobuf-data-from-kafka-to-azure-data-explorer/ba-p/3595793">Ingesting Protobuf data from Kafka to Azure Data Explorer</a>. So, we all know about Protocol buffers (Protobuf) and how it is a language and platform-neutral extensible mechanism for serializing and deserializing structured data. The Protobuf protocol is becoming increasingly popular in the IoT world, especially since Apache Kafka supports Protobuf. In the IoT world, we also see <strong>Azure Data Explorer</strong> being popular as the choice for data processing and analytics. To ingest data from Kafka into Azure Data Explorer, we use the ADX Kafka sink connector. This post looks at how to set up and configure the ADX Kafka sink connector for ingesting Protobuf serialized data.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/event-driven-utopia/comparing-stateful-stream-processing-and-streaming-databases-c8c670f3f4bb">Comparing Stateful Stream Processing and Streaming Databases</a>. When you build an event-driven stream processing system, the question is whether you should use a stateful stream processor or a streaming database. This post aims to clarify stream processing vs streaming database. After reading the post, you should know how these technologies work internally, their differences, and when to use them.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/confluent-terraform-provider-intro/">Getting Started with the Confluent Terraform Provider</a>. Terraform is an open-source infrastructure-as-code tool that lets you build, change, and version your cloud or on-prem data infrastructure safely and efficiently. Back in July, Confluent announced support for a Terraform provider for Confluent Cloud. This post takes a closer look at what the provider supports and how to use it.</li>
<li><a href="https://itnext.io/exploring-popular-open-source-stream-processing-technologies-part-1-of-2-31069337ba0e">Exploring Popular Open-source Stream Processing Technologies: Part 1 of 2</a>. This post is part 1 of a two-part series demonstrating stream processing using: Apache Spark Structured Streaming, Apache Kafka Streams, Apache Flink, and Apache Pinot with Apache Superset! The post is awesome! Part of what makes it extraordinary is the accompanying <a href="https://github.com/garystafford/streaming-sales-generator"><strong>Streaming Synthetic Sales Data Generator</strong></a>, a Python project for generating synthetic data. I have forked the project and will use it whenever I need to generate streaming data.</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://pub.towardsai.net/this-is-how-you-can-build-a-churn-prediction-model-using-spark-e187b7eca339">This Is How You Can Build a Churn Prediction Model Using Apache Spark</a>. At <a href="/derivco">Derivco</a>, we&rsquo;re looking at creating ML models for churn, so lately, I&rsquo;ve been reading posts around this subject. I came across this post, a tutorial on building a churn prediction classifier using the ML stack from Spark. Very interesting and informative!</li>
<li><a href="https://pub.towardsai.net/introduction-to-confusion-matrix-50676f2756ee">Introduction to Confusion Matrix</a>. When I first heard the term confusion matrix, I thought it was called so because you became confused trying to interpret it, ðŸ˜„. Anyway, this post tries to explain what a confusion matrix is and how you can plot one using Python. When reading the post, remember that the algorithm used is to predict someone is sick.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="distributed-computing">Distributed Computing</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://thesecretlivesofdata.com/raft/">Raft - Understandable Distributed Consensus</a>. Raft is a consensus algorithm that is designed to be easy to understand. Going forward, Kafka will use Raft instead of ZooKeeper. The page linked to is a visualization of how Raft works. My first thought was that &ldquo;this looks very much like a distributed transaction&rdquo;. Anyway, the visualization is very cool!</li>
<li><a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/">Patterns of Distributed Systems</a>. If you think: &ldquo;has Niels not linked to this before&rdquo;, you are absolutely correct. In 2020 I linked to this in one of my <a href="/2020/08/16/interesting-stuff---week-33-2020/">roundups</a>. At that stage, the compendium about the patterns for distributed systems was a work in progress. Now it is completed, and if you are interested in distributed systems, you must read it!</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/sync-databases-and-remove-silos-with-kafka-cdc/">Keeping Multiple Databases in Sync Using Kafka Connect and CDC</a>. This blog post looks at how to keep databases in sync using Kafka technologies and CDC. It reviews the advantages and disadvantages of using JDBC and CDC for moving data. It then explores the real use case of how a legacy bank used Kafka Connect to bridge the silos and keep multiple applications/databases in sync.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/error-handling-with-apache-kafka-extension-for-azure-functions/ba-p/3628936">Error Handling with Apache Kafka extension for Azure Functions and more!!</a>. The Kafka extension for Azure functions was released recently with some cool features. As a side note, we (<a href="/derivco">Derivco</a>) are using it - awesome! Anyway, this post looks at some features in the Kafka extension. I particularly like the error handling (not that my code has any errors, but &hellip; ðŸ˜„).</li>

<p>Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth that has to do with things that interest me:</p>

<ul>
<li>AI/data science</li>
<li>data in general</li>
<li>data architecture</li>
<li>streaming</li>
<li>distributed computing</li>
<li>SQL Server</li>
<li>transactions (both db as well as non db)</li>
<li>and other &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>This blog post is the &ldquo;roundup&rdquo; of the things that have been most interesting to me for the week just ending.</p>

<h2 id="misc">Misc.</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/10-vscode-productivity-hacks-for-data-scientists-1836f87e0525">10 VSCode Productivity Hacks for Data Scientists</a>. Yes, I know; the title of this post says Data Scientists. With that in mind, I should have put it under the <strong>AI/ML</strong> section. However, the &ldquo;hacks&rdquo; in the post are not only useful for Data Scientists but for anyone using Python and VSCode. The post is not so much about hacks as it is about useful VSCode extensions, and I picked up a couple that I want to test.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="azure-data-explorer">Azure Data Explorer</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://arcanecode.com/2022/09/12/fun-with-kql-format_datetime/">Fun With KQL â€“ Format_DateTime</a>. I hate dealing with date-time! That&rsquo;s why I really like the Kusto Query Language (KQL) feature that this post discusses: the <code>format_datime</code> function. Read the post to see how it can be used. Very cool!</li>
<li><a href="https://detective.kusto.io/">Kusto Detective Agency</a>. The Kusto Detective Agency is a way to promote <em>Azure Data Explorer</em> and the <strong>KQL</strong> (the Kusto Query Language). You join the &ldquo;agency&rdquo; by creating a free Azure Data Explorer cluster and providing an answer to a question. Looks really cool. I joined earlier in the week, and I&rsquo;ll keep you informed on how it goes.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ai-ml">AI/ML</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/serving-ml-models-with-apache-spark-3adc278f7a78">Serving ML Models with Apache Spark</a>. This post covers more than what the title says. Yes, the post definitely looks at how to serve up <strong>MLLib</strong> models, but it also gives a comprehensive introduction to Spark. Very useful!</li>

Having observability of your infrastructure is of vital importance to be able to detect, diagnose, and remediate issues. This post looks at what LinkedIn has done to provide observability into network flows. Very interesting!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/real-time-gaming-infrastructure-kafka-ksqldb-websockets/">Real-Time Gaming Infrastructure for Millions of Users with Apache Kafka, ksqlDB, and WebSockets</a>. This post which shows a real-time gamification demo to integrate gamers via WebSockets to the data streaming backend infrastructure is interesting to me from a couple of points. It is interesting as we (<a href="/derivco">Derivco</a>) are in the iGaming industry. It is also interesting as we are doing something very similar right now!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><p style="text-align: center;">Deep Learning</p></strong></p>

<p>Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth that has to do with things that interest me:</p>

<ul>
<li>AI/data science</li>
<li>data in general</li>
<li>data architecture</li>
<li>streaming</li>
<li>distributed computing</li>
<li>SQL Server</li>
<li>transactions (both db as well as non db)</li>
<li>and other &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>This blog post is the &ldquo;roundup&rdquo; of the things that have been most interesting to me for the week just ending.</p>

<li><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-data-explorer-blog/use-fresh-and-unlimited-volume-of-adx-data-kusto-from-your/ba-p/3588894">Use fresh and unlimited volume of ADX data (Kusto) from your favorite analytic tool - Excel pivot</a>. For a while, Excel has had the ability to query data in <strong>Azure Data Explorer</strong> - yay! The slightly negative aspect of this was that typically data in ADX is counted in billions, and to query the data in Excel, you had to bring the data into Excel first - goodbye memory! The post linked to looks at a way to query ADX data in real-time without importing any data and without any volume limitations.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="data-science-machine-learning-ai">Data Science / Machine Learning / AI</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/6-papers-every-modern-data-scientist-must-read-1d0e708becd">6 Papers Every Modern Data Scientist Must Read</a>. This post brings up a point which is very dear to me - that to be on top of your chosen technologies, you need to understand the foundation and building blocks of said technologies. Anyway, the technology referred to in this post is deep learning, and the post lists white papers covering some of the most essential modern fundamentals of Deep Learning everyone in the field show be familiar with.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="data-architecture-big-data">Data Architecture / Big Data</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://mrpaulandrew.com/2022/08/01/building-a-data-mesh-architecture-in-azure-part-13-how-to-organise-data-domains-in-practice/">Building a Data Mesh Architecture in Azure â€“ Part 13 â€“ How To Organise Data Domains In Practice</a>. This post is part of a series on how to build a Data Mesh on Azure. As the post&rsquo;s subtitle implies, this &ldquo;episode&rdquo; looks at data domains. Use <a href="https://mrpaulandrew.com/tag/data-mesh-vs-azure/">this link</a> if you are interested in reading more in this series. As a side note - there has been quite a debate (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6919930275212726272/">link here</a>) around this implementation vs. the original data mesh &ldquo;principles&rdquo; as outlined by Zhamak Dehghani <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-mesh-principles.html">here</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.databricks.com/blog/2022/08/03/announcing-the-preview-of-serverless-compute-for-databricks-sql-on-azure-databricks.html">Announcing the Preview of Serverless Compute for Databricks SQL on Azure Databricks</a>. Databricks SQL is a serverless data warehouse on the Databricks Lakehouse Platform. It was initially previewed in late 2020, and this post announces the public preview on Azure. We at <a href="/derivco">Derivco</a> have been waiting for this!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/database-modernization-integrate-data-with-any-cloud/">Getting Started with Database Modernization</a>. Before you read the post linked to, I suggest you read <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/cloud-data-migrations-database-modernization-with-confluent/">Accelerate Cloud Database Modernizations and Migrations with Confluent</a>, which starts looking at the journey to easily migrate data to any cloud database for real-time data streaming, integration, and analytics. I suggest you read that post before this because this post builds on that one and looks at the steps you need to take to get started on your database modernization journey.</li>
<li><a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/data-mesh-a-data-movement-and-processing-platform-netflix-1288bcab2873">Data Mesh â€” A Data Movement and Processing Platform @ Netflix</a>. Another post about Data Mesh, but in this case, the Data Mesh is not what we would think it is, i.e. what&rsquo;s mentioned above. Data Mesh is the Netflix Data Mesh, a fully managed streaming data pipeline product. The Data Mesh was introduced around a year ago. Since then, it has evolved, and this post is the first in a series covering different aspects of Data Mesh and lessons learned throughout the journey.</li>

<p><strong><p style="text-align: center;">Conference</p></strong></p>

<p>Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth that has to do with things that interest me:</p>

<ul>

<li>and other &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>This blog post is the &ldquo;roundup&rdquo; of the things that have been most interesting to me for the week just ending.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="misc">Misc.</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://rmoff.net/2022/07/20/how-to-write-a-good-tech-conference-abstract-learn-from-the-mistakes-of-others/">How to Write a Good Tech Conference Abstract - Learn from the Mistakes of Others</a>. I guess the title says it all. Things to think about when writing conference abstracts. This post by <a href="https://twitter.com/rmoff">Robin Moffat</a> is very valuable, but it should have come somewhat earlier. Why - you ask? Well, the conference &ldquo;season&rdquo; is upon us, and I have submitted quite a few abstracts. Unfortunately, the majority have been rejected. Maybe the result would have been better following the advice in this post. Anyway, rejections are part of the game - onwards and upwards!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="azure-data-explorer">Azure Data Explorer</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-data-explorer-blog/data-pre-processing-for-azure-data-explorer-with-apache-spark/ba-p/2727993">Data pre-processing for Azure Data Explorer with Apache Spark</a>. So, you want to load data into <strong>Azure Data Explorer</strong>. No problem, ADX has quite a few &ldquo;nifty&rdquo; ways to get the data into it. However, sometimes the data would need some complex data engineering upfront. Something that even ADXs powerful data-transformation capabilities cannot do. If that&rsquo;s the case, this post comes in handy. It looks at how to do it using PySpark and the notebook experience in Azure Synapse Analytics. Have Fun!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2022/07/19/confluent-addresses-major-real-time-application-roadblocks-with-q3-update/">Confluent addresses major real-time application roadblocks with Q3 update</a>. This post looks at how Confluent partnered with Hashicorp to introduce a Terraform provider. The integration exposes Confluent cloud APIs for automated deployment and management of mission-critical data streaming resources. This is just the right time for us at <a href="/derivco">Derivco</a> as we are introducing Confluent Cloud right now!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/introducing-confluent-platform-7-2/">Introducing Confluent Platform 7.2: Enhanced Cloud-Native Security and Geo-Replication</a>. This post announces the release of Confluent Platform 7.2. The release covers three major areas: simplified cluster ops, improved data sharing, and improved stream processing capabilities via ksqlDB 0.26.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="wind-what-is-niels-doing">WIND (What Is Niels Doing)</h2>

<p>Above I was &ldquo;moaning&rdquo; about my abstracts being rejected. But, as you can see from the picture up top, &ldquo;all is not lost&rdquo;. I am presenting at <a href="https://dataplatformgeeks.com/dps2022/"><strong>Data Platform Summit 2022</strong></a>, and the session is <strong>ksqlDB - the Real-Time Streaming Database</strong>. So, right now I am prepping for the presentation!</p>

<p>Data Platform Summit is an awesome conference, it is this year as well virtual. So no traveling needed, hurry up and sign up <a href="https://dataplatformgeeks.com/dps2022/booking/">here</a>. Its is <strong>FREE</strong>!</p>
