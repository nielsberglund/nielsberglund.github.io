<h2 id="machine-learning-ai">Machine Learning / AI</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://databricks.com/blog/2021/06/02/jump-start-your-data-projects-with-pre-built-solution-accelerators.html">Jump Start Your Data Projects with Pre-Built Solution Accelerators</a>. There is pressure on data science teams/data engineers/etc., to deliver value fast. However, it takes time to research, build data pipelines, models, etc., and this can suck up momentum. To help to overcome these obstacles, Databricks introduces in this blog post <a href="https://databricks.com/solutions/accelerators"><strong>Databricks Solution Accelerators</strong></a>. These accelerators are fully-functional pre-built code to tackle the most common and high-impact use cases for data scientists, data engineers, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.flowdirector.io/new-smart-app-kafka-to-kafka-bridge-788883a68e63">New Smart App: Kafka to Kafka Bridge</a>. This post introduces the <strong>Kafka to Kafka Bridge</strong>. The bridge allows you to create message bridges between topics of the same or different Kafka brokers. We have developed something similar here at <a href="/derivco">Derivco</a>, but I will definitely check this out!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/streaming-data-with-confluent-and-ksqldb-for-new-use-cases-with-ais/">Detecting Patterns of Behaviour in Streaming Maritime AIS Data with Confluent</a>. This is part two in a blog series on streaming a data feed Apache Kafka (the first part is <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/streaming-etl-and-analytics-for-real-time-location-tracking/">here</a>). This post looks at how <strong>ksqlDB</strong> can be used to do aggregations and pattern matching against a data feed. Very cool!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="wind-what-is-niels-doing">WIND (What Is Niels Doing)</h2>

<p>Apart from working on my <a href="https://dataplatformgeeks.com/dps2021/product/big-data-analytics-with-sql-server-2019-big-data-cluster-by-niels-berglund/"><strong>Big Data &amp; Analytics with SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster</strong></a> training class for the <a href="https://dataplatformgeeks.com/dps2021/"><strong>2021 Data Platform Summit</strong></a>, I have started looking into <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/data-explorer-overview"><strong>Azure Data Explorer</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Azure Data Explorer is a fast, fully managed data analytics service for real-time analysis on large volumes of data streaming from applications, websites, IoT devices, and more. I am looking into it because I am thinking of creating some presentations for upcoming conferences and maybe a training class. Watch this space!</p>

<p>Oh, and don&rsquo;t forget - if you <a href="https://dataplatformgeeks.com/dps2021/product/big-data-analytics-with-sql-server-2019-big-data-cluster-by-niels-berglund/">sign up</a> for my training class, mentioned above, at the <strong>2021 Data Platform Summit</strong>, you get free access to the summit itself!</p>

The <a href="https://databricks.com/dataaisummit/north-america-2021"><strong>Data + AI Summit 2021</strong></a> took place the week just gone by. The post I linked to talks about one of the announcements made during the summit; the launch of <strong>Databricks Machine Learning</strong>, an enterprise ML solution that is data-native, collaborative, and supports the entire ML lifecycle. I am pretty &ldquo;chuffed&rdquo; to see how the solution includes, among other things, a feature store!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/Ov5XgYzyGkU">Engaging Database Partials with Apache Kafka for Distributed System Consistency ft. Pat Helland</a>. When using various data from different systems, for example, for reports, obtaining the correct data when you need it in real-time can be difficult.

<p>This blog-post is the &ldquo;roundup&rdquo; of the things that have been most interesting to me for the week just ending.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="data-architecture">Data Architecture</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://databricks.com/blog/2021/05/19/evolution-to-the-data-lakehouse.html">Evolution to the Data Lakehouse</a>. Data lakehouses have been a hot topic the last year or two, and Databricks, with its lakehouse implementation Delta Lake has been at the forefront. The post linked to looks - as the title implies - at the evolution from data warehouses to data lakes to data lakehouses. Very interesting!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/wix-engineering/6-event-driven-architecture-patterns-part-1-93758b253f47">6 Event-Driven Architecture Patterns â Part 1</a>. This post is the first of two. The author looks at key patterns of event-driven messaging designs that have facilitated creating a robust distributed system that can easily handle increasing traffic and storage needs. The second part of the series is <a href="https://medium.com/wix-engineering/6-event-driven-architecture-patterns-part-2-455cc73b22e1">here</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://mert.codes/harder-better-faster-stronger-apache-pinot-as-a-kafka-consumer-and-datastore-for-fast-7df25bcc7d02">&ldquo;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger&rdquo;: Apache Pinot as a Kafka Consumer and Datastore for Fast On-the-Fly Aggregations</a>. You who read my blog have probably noticed that I am quite partial to Kafka and Apache Pinot. Well, in this blog post, we get the best of both worlds. It covers how to use Apache Pinot to do aggregations in &ldquo;near&rdquo; real-time. I found the post very interesting.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/error-handling-patterns-in-kafka/">Error Handling Patterns for Apache Kafka Applications</a>. In one of the teams I worked at in <a href="/derivco">Derivco</a>, we had a saying when we were going to do something we were not 100% sure of: <em>How hard can it be, what can possibly go wrong?</em>. In some cases, quite a lot could go wrong, and if we look at distributed systems, what can go wrong often goes wrong. This blog post covers different ways to handle errors and retries in event streaming applications.</li>

    <id>https://nielsberglund.com/2021/02/14/how-to-install-sql-server-on-an-azure-vm/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A while ago, I wanted to do a quick test on a new SQL installation, and I wanted the SQL installation to be on a &ldquo;pristine&rdquo; server. I was not keen on creating a new virtual machine on my local dev-box, as for that I would need to create a VM image etc., and it seemed like too much hassle for a lazy person like me. The obvious choice then is to do it in the cloud. How hard can that be, what could possibly go wrong?!</p>

<p>It turned out to not be as straight-forward as I thought it would be, but eventually, I managed to get it right. Since I probably need to do it again some time, I thought I&rsquo;d write a post about it, so I have something to go back to. So here we go &hellip;</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="pre-reqs">Pre-reqs</h2>

<p>The assumption is that you have an Azure subscription. If you do not, you can sign up for a free account <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="create-resource">Create Resource</h2>

<p>When we have an account/subscription we log onto the portal:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/azure-vm-sql-portal-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> <em>Azure Portal</em></p>

<p>After we have logged in to the portal, we see something like in <em>Figure 1</em>. To create anything in Azure, we create a new Azure resource. We do that via the <em>Create a resource</em> menu.  We click on the &ldquo;hamburger&rdquo; menu we see outlined in red in <em>Figure 1</em> to get to that menu. When clicking on the menu, a list is presented where the first item is <em>Create a resource</em>. Click on that, and we see:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/azure-vm-sql-create-resource-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 2:</strong> <em>Create Resource</em></p>

<p>Looking at <em>Figure 2</em>, I do not see anything that really stands out. Sure, we see some items outlined in red in the figure that relates to data and databases. However, when we &ldquo;drill down&rdquo; into those items there is nothing there that refers explicitly to SQL installations on a VM, it is all more related to managed databases.</p>

<p>I guess we could go into the <em>Compute</em> item and deploy a VM. Having done that, we upload the SQL Server install media and do a manual installation of SQL Server on the VM. However, I don&rsquo;t see that being much better than doing it on a VM on my local machine, and I thought there has to be something better.</p>

<h4 id="azure-sql">Azure SQL</h4>

<p>After extensive &ldquo;research&rdquo;, (read Google:ing), I found something that might help:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/azure-vm-sql-azure-sql-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 3:</strong> <em>Azure SQL - I</em></p>

<p>If I enter <em>Azure SQL</em>, in the <em>Search the Marketplace</em> search-box a drop-down list pops up, (or should it be down), and in the list is an entry for <em>Azure SQL</em> as outlined in red in <em>Figure 3</em>. Clicking on that we get something like so:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/azure-vm-sql-azure-sql-2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 4:</strong> <em>Azure SQL - II</em></p>

<p>In <em>Figure 4</em>, we see how we can create and manage SQL Server resources, including SQL Server virtual machines, (outlined in red).</p>

<p>So let us click on the <em>Create</em> button which in <em>Figure 4</em> is outlined in yellow:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/azure-vm-sql-deploy-option-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 5:</strong> <em>SQL Deployment Option</em></p>

<p>After clicking on the <em>Create</em> button, we see a form as in <em>Figure 5</em>, where we have some choices. We are interested in the <em>SQL virtual machine</em> option which is outlined in red. When we click on the drop-down list-box outlined in yellow, we get a list as so:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/azure-vm-sql-deploy-options.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 6:</strong> <em>SQL &amp; OS Versions</em></p>

<p>The list in <em>Figure 6</em> shows us some of the various SQL Server and operating system versions we can deploy. We see, outlined in red that we want to deploy SQL Server 2019 Developer Edition on Windows Server 2019.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I should have mentioned this in the pre-reqs above; you have to have licenses for the OS and SQL edition you choose.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We choose the version we want to use and click on the <em>Create</em> button.</p>

<h2 id="create-vm">Create VM</h2>

<p>After clicking the <em>Create</em> button we see:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/azure-vm-sql-createvm-new.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 7:</strong> <em>Create a VM</em></p>

<p>In <em>Figure 7</em> we see the top part of the <em>Create a virtual machine</em> page. We see, outlined in red, the &ldquo;tabs&rdquo; for setting up different aspects of the VM.</p>

<h4 id="basics">Basics</h4>

<p>We start at the <em>Basics</em> tab and, as the name implies, here we set the base settings for the VM:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/azure-vm-sql-createvm-basics.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 8:</strong> <em>Basic VM Details</em></p>

<p>What <em>Figure 8</em> shows is the main part of the <em>Basics</em> tab. We see how I have filled in the various details for my VM:</p>

<ul>
<li>the subscription I want to use.</li>
<li>what resource group the VM should be placed in. In this case, I have decided to create a new resource group for the VM: <code>rg-sqlvm</code>.</li>
<li>name of the VM.</li>
<li>the SQL Server image is defaulted to what you chose from the list in <em>Figure 6</em>, but you can change it.</li>
<li>the region where you want the VM to be located.</li>
<li>size of the VM.</li>
<li>various account information</li>
</ul>

<p>I have outlined <em>Region</em> and <em>Size</em> in <em>Figure 8</em> because you may get a different price for your VM depending on the region. So if you just want to do a quick test, choose a region with low price.</p>

<p>Having filled in all necessary information, you can now go ahead and click on the <em>Review + create</em> button in the lower left-hand corner in <em>Figure 8</em>. If you were to do that your VM and SQL installation would be created with default settings and the information you entered under the <em>Basics</em> tab.</p>

<p>In my case, I wanted to configure the VM and SQL installation somewhat, and what I wanted to customise was:</p>

<ul>
<li>Disks</li>
<li>SQL Server settings</li>
</ul>

<p>So, let us move on to <em>Disks</em>.</p>

<h4 id="disks">Disks</h4>

<p>I want to customise disks settings because the VM installation uses somewhat expensive Premium SSD disks by default. Since this is just an installation for &ldquo;quick and dirty&rdquo; tests, I want to change to not use the default disks. I click on the <em>Disks</em> tab:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/azure-vm-sql-createvm-disks.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 9:</strong> <em>Disks</em></p>

<p>We see in <em>Figure 9</em> how I have chosen <em>Standard HDD</em> as disk type form my VM. That is the only thing I change related to disks for my installation, and I now go on to SQL settings.</p>

<h4 id="sql-server-settings">SQL Server Settings</h4>

<p>There are a couple of things I want to change related to SQL Settings:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/azure-vm-sql-createvm-sql-settings-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 10:</strong> <em>SQL Server Settings - I</em></p>

<p>In <em>Figure 10</em>, outlined in red, we see some of the settings I want to change:</p>

<ul>
<li>I change the networking to be <em>Public</em> to connect directly to SQL Server over port 1433.</li>
<li>I enable SQL authentication. The login name and password default to what you set up for the VM.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is one more SQL setting I want to change:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/azure-vm-sql-createvm-sql-settings-2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 11:</strong> <em>SQL Server Settings - II</em></p>

<p>Since I am doing some SQL Server Machine Learning Services, we see in <em>Figure 11</em> how I have enabled it.</p>

<p>There is nothing more I want to change, so I click the <em>Review + create</em> button outlined in red in <em>Figure 11</em>.</p>

<h4 id="review-create">Review &amp; Create</h4>

<p>When I click the <em>Review + create</em> button, I am presented with the VM and SQL Server settings. When I am happy with the settings I click <em>Create</em>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/azure-vm-sql-createvm-review-create-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 12:</strong> <em>Create VM - I</em></p>

<p>In <em>Figure 12</em> we see how the deployment has started, and - outlined in yellow - we see the various components being deployed and the state of the deployment. After a while we see something like so:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/azure-vm-sql-createvm-review-create-2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 13:</strong> <em>Create VM - II</em></p>

<p>The deployment has finished as we see in <em>Figure 13</em>, and we can click the <em>Go to resource</em> button:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/azure-vm-sql-createvm-review-create-3.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 14:</strong> <em>Deployed Resource</em></p>

<p>Clicking the button takes us to the VM and shows information about the VM as we see in <em>Figure 14</em>. What interests us is what we see outlined in red - the public IP address.</p>

<h2 id="connecting-to-sql-server">Connecting to SQL Server</h2>

<p>Having the address, we can connect to the SQL Server. My tool of choice for connecting to SQL is Azure Data Studio, (ADS):</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/azure-vm-sql-connect-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 15:</strong> <em>Connection Dialog</em></p>

<p>To connect I enter the connection details in the ADS <em>Connection</em> dialog as in <em>Figure 15</em>, and then I click <em>Connect</em>, (outlined in red):</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/azure-vm-sql-connect-2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 16:</strong> <em>SQL Server Overview</em></p>

<p>After I have connected I see in the Server Explorer my new instance, (outlined in red), and an overview of the installed instance, (outlined in yellow).</p>

<p>I can now go ahead and create databases, running queries, etc. like I would do on an on-prem SQL Server!</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>To summarise:</p>

<ul>
<li>Log in to the Azure Portal.</li>
<li>Add a new Azure SQL resource.</li>
<li>Choose the SQL virtual machine deployment option.</li>
<li>Enter the settings for the VM and the SQL Server instance.</li>
<li>Deploy the VM and SQL Server.</li>
</ul>

<p>This blog-post is the &ldquo;roundup&rdquo; of the things that have been most interesting to me, for the week just ending.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="big-data">Big Data</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/apache-pinot-developer-blog/real-time-analytics-with-presto-and-apache-pinot-part-i-cc672caea307">Real-time Analytics with Presto and Apache Pinot â Part I</a>. I have written in previous roundups about Presto, which is now called Trino, and Apache Pinot. The blog post linked to here is the first in a two part series about how to use Presto and Pinot together. The second part is <a href="https://medium.com/apache-pinot-developer-blog/real-time-analytics-with-presto-and-apache-pinot-part-ii-3d09ff937713">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="data-architecture">Data Architecture</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/the-3-things-to-keep-in-mind-while-building-the-modern-data-stack-5d076743b33a">The 3 Things to Keep in Mind While Building the Modern Data Stack</a>. Building a data stack, never mind a modern data stack, can be confusing and complicated. This post proposes a simplified framework for creating the stack. The post looks at a conceptual model to help us when we pick the tools for the stack. I found the post very informative!</li>
<li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-data-mesh-and-should-you-mesh-it-up-too-364b28fe2ae9">What Is Data Mesh? And Should You Mesh It Up Too?</a>. Recently I have mentioned data meshes quite a lot. Here is another post about data meshes. It looks at what a Data Mesh is, and why more and more companies are looking to implement them.</li>
<li><a href="https://databricks.com/blog/2021/02/04/how-lakehouses-solve-common-issues-with-data-warehouses.html">How Lakehouses Solve Common Issues With Data Warehouses</a>. In <a href="/2021/01/31/interesting-stuff---week-5-2021/">last weeks roundup</a> I linked to a video about data Lakehouses. The post I link to here is the first in a series about Lakehouses, and it is based on <a href="http://cidrdb.org/cidr2021/papers/cidr2021_paper17.pdf">this white-paper</a>. I am certainly looking forward to the other posts in the series.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/consume-avro-data-from-kafka-topics-and-secured-schema-registry-with-databricks-confluent-cloud-on-azure/">Consuming Avro Data from Apache Kafka Topics and Schema Registry with Databricks and Confluent Cloud on Azure</a>. Last <a href="/2021/01/31/interesting-stuff---week-5-2021/">week</a> I posted a <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-seamless-integration-between-microsoft-azure-and-confluent-cloud/">link</a> about integration between Confluent Cloud and Microsoft Azure. I wrote that I hoped to see blog posts from the Confluent guys, (and girls), where they do &ldquo;cool stuff&rdquo; on Azure and not only AWS and Google Cloud. Well ask, and you shall be given! The post linked to here discusses how to configure Azure Databricks to interact with Confluent Cloud so that you can ingest, process, store, make real-time predictions and gain business insights from your data.</li>
<li><a href="https://joshua-robinson.medium.com/simplify-kafka-at-scale-with-confluent-tiered-storage-ae8c1a2c9c80">Simplify Kafka at Scale with Confluent Tiered Storage</a>. In October 2020, Confluent announced Confluent Platform 6.0, and how one of the new features was <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/confluent-platform-6-0-delivers-the-most-powerful-event-streaming-platform-to-date/#tired-storage">tiered storage</a>. This post looks at how tiered storage works, how to set it up, and performance implications. Very interesting!</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth, that has to do with things that interest me:</p>

<ul>
<li>data science</li>
<li>data in general</li>
<li>distributed computing</li>
<li>SQL Server</li>
<li>transactions (both db as well as non db)</li>
<li>and other &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>This blog-post is the &ldquo;roundup&rdquo; of the things that have been most interesting to me, for the week just ending.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="big-data">Big Data</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T70jTTYhYyM">Intro to Apache Pinot</a>. In <a href="/2021/01/24/interesting-stuff---week-4-2021/">last weeks roundup</a>, I posted a video link about doing real-time analytics using Apache Pinto and Kafka. What I have linked to here is to an awesome video introducing what Pinot is. If you are interested, it is a must-see!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU2dXoVU8hY">Lakehouse: A New Generation of Open Platforms that Unify Data Warehousing and Advanced Analytics</a>. In some of the previous roundups I have written about Data Meshes, and how the Data Mesh is a hot topic today in the Big Data world. The video I have linked to here discusses another hot topic: the Lakehouse architecture. A Lakehouse is a data management system based on lowcost and directly-accessible storage that also provides traditional analytical DBMS management and performance features.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/expedia-group-tech/a-short-introduction-to-apache-iceberg-d34f628b6799">A Short Introduction to Apache Iceberg</a>. Part of the Lakehouse architecture is the table format. The table format allows for ACID transaction capability as well as data versioning, etc. Some table formats out there are Databricks Delta Lake, Apache Hudi, and Apache Iceberg. The post linked to here looks at Apache Iceberg, and what we can do with it.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-seamless-integration-between-microsoft-azure-and-confluent-cloud/">Introducing seamless integration between Microsoft Azure and Confluent Cloud</a>. Well, I guess the title says it all! We finally have a transparent integration between Azure and Confluent Cloud. Hopefully, we&rsquo;ll now start to see posts from the Confluent guys, (and girls), where they do &ldquo;cool stuff&rdquo; on Azure and not only AWS and Google Cloud.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjEYH41nvBM">Streaming Machine Learning with Apache Kafka and without another Data Lake by Kai Waehner</a>. Usually, when we do Machine Learning, both training and inference, we use a data lake - perhaps even a Lakehouse as mentioned above. But it&rsquo;s possible to avoid such a data store altogether, using an event streaming architecture. The video linked to explains how this can be achieved leveraging Apache Kafka, Tiered Storage and TensorFlow.</li>
</ul>
