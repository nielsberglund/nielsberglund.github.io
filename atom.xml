<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/debugging-stream-table-joins/">Debugging of a Stream-Table Join: Failing to Cross the Streams</a>. My team and I have been busy writing ksqlDB queries for the last couple of months, joining streams and tables. This post looks at exactly that! It&rsquo;s an excellent post; the only thing wrong is that it wasn&rsquo;t published sooner. That would have saved us a lot of pain ðŸ˜„.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/schema-registry-for-beginners/">Get Started with Schemas and Schema Registries</a>. Here is another post I wished I had seen sooner. It is an introductory course about the Kafka Schema registry. Well, the post is not the course, but it points to the course&rsquo;s individual modules. Very useful!</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2022/10/05/data-virtualization-with-polybase-for-sql-server-2022/">Data Virtualization with PolyBase for SQL Server 2022</a>. One of the big things back in the day (well, maybe a year or two ago) fro SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster (BDC) was the Polybase support for External Tables against a lot of data sources. That support has now been introduced in your &ldquo;normal&rdquo; SQL Server 2022, and this post looks at this new PolyBase and what you can do with it.</li>

I.e. you can now use KRaft instead of Zookeeper as your metadata controller.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/building-streaming-data-pipelines-visually/">Introducing Stream Designer: The Visual Builder for Streaming Data Pipelines</a>. What this post looks at is something I can&rsquo;t wait to start &ldquo;playing&rdquo; with, the <strong>Stream Designer</strong>.

<h2 id="distributed-systems">Distributed Systems</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://learncsdesigns.medium.com/an-overview-of-distributed-systems-architectures-4719692f8558">An overview of distributed systems architectures</a>. This post is the second in a series on system design. I found this post really useful as an introduction. Very good! Also, look at the links at the right of the post - some excellent &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; in there!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="azure-data-explorer">Azure Data Explorer</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-data-explorer-blog/ingesting-protobuf-data-from-kafka-to-azure-data-explorer/ba-p/3595793">Ingesting Protobuf data from Kafka to Azure Data Explorer</a>. So, we all know about Protocol buffers (Protobuf) and how it is a language and platform-neutral extensible mechanism for serializing and deserializing structured data. The Protobuf protocol is becoming increasingly popular in the IoT world, especially since Apache Kafka supports Protobuf. In the IoT world, we also see <strong>Azure Data Explorer</strong> being popular as the choice for data processing and analytics. To ingest data from Kafka into Azure Data Explorer, we use the ADX Kafka sink connector. This post looks at how to set up and configure the ADX Kafka sink connector for ingesting Protobuf serialized data.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/event-driven-utopia/comparing-stateful-stream-processing-and-streaming-databases-c8c670f3f4bb">Comparing Stateful Stream Processing and Streaming Databases</a>. When you build an event-driven stream processing system, the question is whether you should use a stateful stream processor or a streaming database. This post aims to clarify stream processing vs streaming database. After reading the post, you should know how these technologies work internally, their differences, and when to use them.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/confluent-terraform-provider-intro/">Getting Started with the Confluent Terraform Provider</a>. Terraform is an open-source infrastructure-as-code tool that lets you build, change, and version your cloud or on-prem data infrastructure safely and efficiently. Back in July, Confluent announced support for a Terraform provider for Confluent Cloud. This post takes a closer look at what the provider supports and how to use it.</li>
<li><a href="https://itnext.io/exploring-popular-open-source-stream-processing-technologies-part-1-of-2-31069337ba0e">Exploring Popular Open-source Stream Processing Technologies: Part 1 of 2</a>. This post is part 1 of a two-part series demonstrating stream processing using: Apache Spark Structured Streaming, Apache Kafka Streams, Apache Flink, and Apache Pinot with Apache Superset! The post is awesome! Part of what makes it extraordinary is the accompanying <a href="https://github.com/garystafford/streaming-sales-generator"><strong>Streaming Synthetic Sales Data Generator</strong></a>, a Python project for generating synthetic data. I have forked the project and will use it whenever I need to generate streaming data.</li>

At <a href="/derivco">Derivco</a>, we&rsquo;re looking at creating ML models for churn, so lately, I&rsquo;ve been reading posts around this subject. I came across this post, a tutorial on building a churn prediction classifier using the ML stack from Spark. Very interesting and informative!</li>
<li><a href="https://pub.towardsai.net/introduction-to-confusion-matrix-50676f2756ee">Introduction to Confusion Matrix</a>. When I first heard the term confusion matrix, I thought it was called so because you became confused trying to interpret it, ðŸ˜„. Anyway, this post tries to explain what a confusion matrix is and how you can plot one using Python. When reading the post, remember that the algorithm used is to predict someone is sick.</li>

<h2 id="distributed-computing">Distributed Computing</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://thesecretlivesofdata.com/raft/">Raft - Understandable Distributed Consensus</a>. Raft is a consensus algorithm that is designed to be easy to understand. Going forward, Kafka will use Raft instead of ZooKeeper. The page linked to is a visualization of how Raft works. My first thought was that &ldquo;this looks very much like a distributed transaction&rdquo;. Anyway, the visualization is very cool!</li>
<li><a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/">Patterns of Distributed Systems</a>. If you think: &ldquo;has Niels not linked to this before&rdquo;, you are absolutely correct. In 2020 I linked to this in one of my <a href="/2020/08/16/interesting-stuff---week-33-2020/">roundups</a>.

<ul>
<li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/10-vscode-productivity-hacks-for-data-scientists-1836f87e0525">10 VSCode Productivity Hacks for Data Scientists</a>. Yes, I know; the title of this post says Data Scientists. With that in mind, I should have put it under the <strong>AI/ML</strong> section. However, the &ldquo;hacks&rdquo; in the post are not only useful for Data Scientists but for anyone using Python and VSCode. The post is not so much about hacks as it is about useful VSCode extensions, and I picked up a couple that I want to test.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://arcanecode.com/2022/09/12/fun-with-kql-format_datetime/">Fun With KQL â€“ Format_DateTime</a>. I hate dealing with date-time! That&rsquo;s why I really like the Kusto Query Language (KQL) feature that this post discusses: the <code>format_datime</code> function. Read the post to see how it can be used. Very cool!</li>
<li><a href="https://detective.kusto.io/">Kusto Detective Agency</a>. The Kusto Detective Agency is a way to promote <em>Azure Data Explorer</em> and the <strong>KQL</strong> (the Kusto Query Language). You join the &ldquo;agency&rdquo; by creating a free Azure Data Explorer cluster and providing an answer to a question. Looks really cool. I joined earlier in the week, and I&rsquo;ll keep you informed on how it goes.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ai-ml">AI/ML</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/serving-ml-models-with-apache-spark-3adc278f7a78">Serving ML Models with Apache Spark</a>. This post covers more than what the title says.

For a while, Excel has had the ability to query data in <strong>Azure Data Explorer</strong> - yay! The slightly negative aspect of this was that typically data in ADX is counted in billions, and to query the data in Excel, you had to bring the data into Excel first - goodbye memory! The post linked to looks at a way to query ADX data in real-time without importing any data and without any volume limitations.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="data-science-machine-learning-ai">Data Science / Machine Learning / AI</h2>

Another post about Data Mesh, but in this case, the Data Mesh is not what we would think it is, i.e. what&rsquo;s mentioned above. Data Mesh is the Netflix Data Mesh, a fully managed streaming data pipeline product. The Data Mesh was introduced around a year ago. Since then, it has evolved, and this post is the first in a series covering different aspects of Data Mesh and lessons learned throughout the journey.</li>

I guess the title says it all. Things to think about when writing conference abstracts. This post by <a href="https://twitter.com/rmoff">Robin Moffat</a> is very valuable, but it should have come somewhat earlier. Why - you ask? Well, the conference &ldquo;season&rdquo; is upon us, and I have submitted quite a few abstracts. Unfortunately, the majority have been rejected. Maybe the result would have been better following the advice in this post. Anyway, rejections are part of the game - onwards and upwards!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="azure-data-explorer">Azure Data Explorer</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-data-explorer-blog/data-pre-processing-for-azure-data-explorer-with-apache-spark/ba-p/2727993">Data pre-processing for Azure Data Explorer with Apache Spark</a>. So, you want to load data into <strong>Azure Data Explorer</strong>. No problem, ADX has quite a few &ldquo;nifty&rdquo; ways to get the data into it. However, sometimes the data would need some complex data engineering upfront. Something that even ADXs powerful data-transformation capabilities cannot do. If that&rsquo;s the case, this post comes in handy. It looks at how to do it using PySpark and the notebook experience in Azure Synapse Analytics. Have Fun!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>

</ul>

<h2 id="wind-what-is-niels-doing">WIND (What Is Niels Doing)</h2>

<p>Above I was &ldquo;moaning&rdquo; about my abstracts being rejected. But, as you can see from the picture up top, &ldquo;all is not lost&rdquo;. I am presenting at <a href="https://dataplatformgeeks.com/dps2022/"><strong>Data Platform Summit 2022</strong></a>, and the session is <strong>ksqlDB - the Real-Time Streaming Database</strong>. So, right now I am prepping for the presentation!</p>

<p>Data Platform Summit is an awesome conference, it is this year as well virtual. So no traveling needed, hurry up and sign up <a href="https://dataplatformgeeks.com/dps2022/booking/">here</a>. Its is <strong>FREE</strong>!</p>

This post discusses a pattern for continuously streaming data from Application Insights data to ADX.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/flow-usage">Usage examples for Azure Data Explorer connector to Power Automate</a>. I love <strong>Azure Data Explorer</strong> (heh- who would have thunk), but there is some &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; that frustrates me. Among them is that it is hard (neigh impossible) to do things based on scheduled tasks, triggers, etc. Well, neigh impossible until you read this Microsoft doc. This document looks at how to &ldquo;hook up&rdquo; <a href="https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Power Automate</a> to ADX, and it also includes several typical Power Automate connector usage examples. Very cool!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwyttaal5U3r9jnHSaGT75sRqSfNDrX11">Azure Data Explorer L300 Workshop</a>.

This post is the second in a series exploring concepts, features, and trade-offs of a modern data stack using a data warehouse, data lake, and data streaming together. You find the first part <a href="https://www.kai-waehner.de/blog/2022/06/27/data-warehouse-vs-data-lake-vs-data-streaming-friends-enemies-frenemies/">here</a>. In this post, the author looks at how data streaming technologies are a perfect fit for data ingestion into data warehouses, data lakes, etc. This post came at the precisely right time as we at <a href="/derivco">Derivco</a> are looking at this (ingestion into data lakes) now.</li>

<p>In the beginning of July MVP&rsquo;s around the world are on tenterhooks, as it is MVP renewal time: &ldquo;will I be an MVP for another year?&rdquo;. After the &ldquo;judgement&rdquo; you then see the LinkedIn feed be flooded by MVP&rsquo;s posts how happy they are that have been renewed. Last year was a bit silly seeing all the posts, since everyone was renewed automatically, and we knew about it beforehand.</p>

<p>With all that said, as you can see from the pictures at the top, I was renewed! Yay!!</p>

<p>At the same time of renewal, but entirely independent, I received this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/mvp-swag-2022-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> <em>MVP SWAG</em></p>

<p>Yup, MVP SWAG: hoodie, coffee cup and a Thank You card! Very cool, THANK YOU, Microsoft and the MVP Program!</p>

<p><strong><p style="text-align: center;">Data Vault</p></strong></p>

<p>Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth that has to do with things that interest me:</p>

<ul>
<li>AI/data science</li>
<li>data in general</li>
<li>data architecture</li>
<li>streaming</li>
<li>distributed computing</li>
<li>SQL Server</li>
<li>transactions (both db as well as non db)</li>
<li>and other &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>This blog post is the &ldquo;roundup&rdquo; of the things that have been most interesting to me for the week just ending.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="sql-server">SQL Server</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2022/06/30/introducing-the-sql-server-2022-blog-series/">Microsoft SQL Server Blog</a>. If you follow what happens in the database world, you probably know that Microsoft SQL Server 2022 is now in Public Preview. This version of SQL Server promises to be a pretty impressive release, so I suggest two things: <a href="https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-sql-server-2022.html">download the preview</a> and test it out, and bookmark the SQL Server 2022 Blogging Series page in the linked post to follow along and see future blog posts.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="azure-data-explorer">Azure Data Explorer</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.playfab.com/blog/take-advantage-of-azure-data-explorer-with-playfab-data-connections">Take advantage of Azure Data Explorer with Playfab data connections</a>. PlayFab is a complete backend platform for live games with managed game services, real-time analytics, and LiveOps, and you can read more about it <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/playfab/what-is-playfab">here</a>. This post announces how there is now an <strong>Azure Data Explorer</strong> connector for PlayFab. Based on what we are doing in <a href="/derivco">Derivco</a>, PlayFab sounds like something we really should look into, and having <strong>Azure Data Explorer</strong> connectors makes it even more so.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="data-architecture">Data Architecture</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2022/06/28/databricks-strikes-back/">Databricks strikes back</a>. Databricks held its <a href="https://databricks.com/dataaisummit/">Data+AI Summit 2022</a> last week (June 27 - 30). The post linked to was published the same day as the Summit started, and it looks at the full range of announcements during the conference (yes, the author of the post was pre-briefed by Databricks). Some very cool &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; there!</li>
<li><a href="https://databricks.com/blog/2022/06/24/prescriptive-guidance-for-implementing-a-data-vault-model-on-the-databricks-lakehouse-platform.html">Prescriptive Guidance for Implementing a Data Vault Model on the Databricks Lakehouse Platform</a>. Another Databricks-related post, this one by Databricks themselves. The post discusses Data Vault&rsquo;s and how to implement them within the Bronze/Silver/Gold layer. It also looks at how to get the best performance of Data Vault with Databricks Lakehouse Platform.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@robgolder/kafka-streams-state-store-30110bf4f24">Kafka Streams: State Store</a>. Kafka Streams stateful processing enables grouping related events that arrive at different times. Operations such as joins, reduce, counts, and aggregations can then be performed on them. That is all well and good, but the previously mentioned functionality would require state to be stored. This post dives into how state is stored in KStreams, and I found it very informative!</li>

<h2 id="data-architecture">Data Architecture</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://databricks.com/blog/2022/06/24/data-warehousing-modeling-techniques-and-their-implementation-on-the-databricks-lakehouse-platform.html">Data Warehousing Modeling Techniques and Their Implementation on the Databricks Lakehouse Platform</a>. This post talks about the different data modelling techniques supported by the Databricks Lakehouse Platform and how each fits within each layer of the Bronze, Silver, and Gold architecture. For me, this post is very timely as we are right now implementing a Data Lakehouse here at <a href="/derivco">Derivco</a>!</li>

Very, very cool, and this comes at the right time for a project we are starting at <a href="/derivco">Derivco</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/data-pipeline-principles-use-cases-examples/">Applying Data Pipeline Principles in Practice: Exploring the Kafka Summit Keynote Demo</a>.

<h2 id="wind-what-is-niels-doing">WIND (What Is Niels Doing)</h2>

<p>By now, you probably wonder what the picture at the top has to do with anything. So last week, Microsoft ran an <a href="https://openhack.microsoft.com/">OpenHack</a> here at <a href="/derivco">Derivco</a>. The topic of the OpenHack was <strong>Modern Data Warehousing</strong>, covering Azure Data Lake Storage, Azure Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics and other cool stuff. Anyway, the OpenHack ran for three days, and on the last day, Microsoft had an event in our canteen where Derivco&rsquo;s employees had the chance to talk to various people from Microsoft.</p>

<p>Part of this event was the &ldquo;selfie booth&rdquo;, and in the picture, you see me sitting beside <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lee-anne-james-96514023/">Lee-Anne James</a>, who is our contact at Microsoft for all Data and AI. I cannot express enough how awesome she is. She really goes all out for us! Thanks, Lee-Anne!</p>

<p>So I mentioned the &ldquo;selfie booth&rdquo;, and part of the deal was that if you took a selfie and published it on your blog, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc., you got some swag:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/synapse-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> <em>Azure Synapse Analytics Swag</em></p>

<p>In <em>Figure 1</em> you see the swag I managed to score - not bad!</p>

<p>Oh, I also managed to publish a blog post around some &ldquo;weird&rdquo; Git errors:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/2022/06/25/solution-to-git-unsafe-repository-some-repo-is-owned-by-someone-else/">Solution to GIT: &ldquo;unsafe repository (&lsquo;some-repo&rsquo; is owned by someone else)&rdquo;</a>. I recently re-formatted my PC, and after everything was installed again, I got a &ldquo;weird&rdquo; error when I tried to do a <code>git pull</code>. The post looks at why I got the error and how to fix it.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/posts/git.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Git</strong> <em>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@synkevych?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Roman Synkevych ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/git-repository?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></em></p>

<p>Every 6 - 9 months (or so), I clean up my development PC just to keep it &ldquo;lean and mean&rdquo;. I do it by formatting the hard-drive partition the OS (in this case, Windows) is on, followed by a new install. Recently I had a four-day weekend here in SA. Four glorious days off, a perfect time to &ldquo;nuke&rdquo; my PC and re-install!</p>

<p></p>

<p>Off I go, everything goes to plan (<a href="https://community.chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a> is my friend), and after a while, I am done (or as done as one can be). At this stage, I needed to do my <a href="/2022/06/19/interesting-stuff---week-24-2022/">weekly roundup blog post</a> for the week gone by, and as I had done some changes to the GitHub repo from my <strong>MacBook Pro</strong>, I wanted to do a <code>git pull</code> in the repo directory for my blog. Part of the story is that on my dev PC, I have all my repos on a separate partition from the system partition, so the non-system partition was un-affected by the reformat (or so I thought). Imagine my surprise when doing the <code>git pull</code> I got:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/git-unsafe-repo-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> <em>Unsafe Repository</em></p>

<p>Hmm, the error we see in <em>Figure 1</em> does not make any sense at all. It is my repo, I created it, so what is the problem?</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>Trying to narrow down the issue, I did a <code>git clone</code> into a new directory of the same repo I couldn&rsquo;t <code>pull</code>, which worked perfectly! I went over to my MacBook and did a <code>pull</code> against the same repo that failed previously, and that worked as well. By now, I was utterly dumbfounded, so I started to do proper research (read Googled), and I came across <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71901632/fatal-error-unsafe-repository-home-repon-is-owned-by-someone-else/71949648#71949648">this post</a>, which talked about security vulnerabilities in the Git client, and how they had been fixed in version <code>2.35.2</code>. When I checked my version, it was <code>2.36.1</code>, so I might be on to something here.</p>

<p>When reading about the security vulnerability in the link above, I came across this:</p>

<p><em>This version changes Git&rsquo;s behavior when looking for a top-level <code>.git</code> directory to stop when its directory traversal changes ownership from the current user.</em></p>

<p>Hmm, ownership and current user, let&rsquo;s look at the directory where the <code>pull</code> failed:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/git-unsafe-repo-owner-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 2:</strong> <em>Directory Ownership</em></p>

<p>When looking at the advanced security settings for the directory, I saw something like in <em>Figure 2</em>, a &ldquo;weird&rdquo; looking owner of the directory. Actually, it is not that weird; it is a security identifier (<code>SID</code>). A <code>SID</code> in the Windows OS identifies a user, user group, or other security principal.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> To get to the advanced security settings, I right-clicked on the directory, chose <strong>Properties</strong>, clicked on the <strong>Security</strong> tab, and in the <strong>Security</strong> tab, I clicked the <strong>Advanced</strong> button.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From what we see in <em>Figure 2</em>, it is evident that the directory owner is not the same as the current user, i.e. me. Before we look at ways to fix the issue, let&rsquo;s understand why the owner is not myself. I created the directory at one point, so the owner should be me.</p>

<p>The answer is that the directory sits on a different partition/hard drive. When I reformatted the machine, the ownership was transferred to the particular <code>SID</code> since I was not &ldquo;around&rdquo;.</p>

<p>So now we know the reason and why it happened; let&rsquo;s fix it.</p>

<h2 id="fix-the-issue">Fix the Issue</h2>

<p>The obvious way to fix the problem is to change the directory owner to me. This can be done in the <strong>Advanced Security Settings</strong> we saw before:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/git-unsafe-repo-change-owner.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 3:</strong> <em>Change Owner</em></p>

<p>In <em>Figure 3</em>, we see how it is done. I clicked the <strong>Change</strong> button (outlined in blue), which brought up the <em>Select User or Group</em> dialog. I entered my user name in the textbox (outlined in red) and then clicked <strong>OK</strong>. I am now back to being the directory owner, and when doing a <code>git pull</code>, everything works!</p>

<p>This is one way to change the owner. The problem with this is that if you have quite a few repo directories under a &ldquo;root&rdquo; directory (as I do), then it can become a bit tedious to do it: right-click directory, <strong>Properties</strong>, <strong>Security</strong>, <strong>Advanced</strong>, <strong>Change</strong> - for each directory. It would be cool if one could do something more batch-like.</p>

<p>On Windows, we have a pretty neat tool that allows taking ownership of a file or folder using the command-line interface. The tool is <code>takeown.exe</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ takeown /f . /r /d Y
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 1:</strong> <em>Take Ownership</em></p>

<p>In <em>Code Snippet 1</em>, we see how I am in the root directory of my Git repos and how I call <code>takeown</code>. The parameters are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>/f</code>: the directory or file to take ownership of. We see how I have defined <code>/f .</code>, (dot), which indicates the current directory.</li>
<li><code>/r</code>: performs a recursive operation on all files in the specified directory and subdirectories.</li>
<li><code>/d</code>: suppresses the confirmation prompt that is displayed when the current user does not have the <code>List Folder</code> permission on a specified directory and instead uses the specified default value. In my case, I used <code>Y</code>, which indicates to take ownership.</li>
</ul>

<p>Be aware that the above recurses through all directories and files, so it may take a while.</p>

<p>Another way to solve the issue, which does not involve changing ownership, is to tell Git that the directory is safe. To mark a directory safe, you use the <code>git config --global --add safe.directory &lt;option&gt;</code> command. The <code>option</code> can be a path to a directory or <code>*</code>, wherein Git treats any directory as safe.</p>

<p>When running <code>git config --global --add safe.directory</code>, the end result is that a <code>[safe]</code> section is being added to the <code>~/.gitconfig file</code>, and the section indicates what is safe:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">[user]
  email = niels.it.berglund@gmail.com
  name = Niels Berglund
[safe]
  directory = *
</code></pre>

<p>*<em>Code Snippet 2:</em> <em>Git Config File</em></p>

<p>In <em>Code Snippet 2</em> we see my <code>~/.config</code> file after I executed <code>git config --global --add safe.directory *</code>.</p>

<p>Remember that if you add a specific directory as <code>safe</code>, any changes to the directory name or path will cause the error to re-occur. However, if you add all directories as safe (or change ownership), you do not need to worry about name or path changes. It will just work.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>This post looked at what causes the <em>unsafe repository (&lsquo;some-repo&rsquo; is owned by someone else)</em> Git error. We said that this error occurs when you run a Git client with a version of <code>2.35.2</code> or higher and execute a Git command in a directory owned by someone else than the user executing the command.</p>

<p>The way to solve this is to either change the ownership of the directory/directories or mark them as safe.</p>

<p>Having re-installed Windows, it is now time to do my <strong>MacBook Pro</strong> as well. Wish me luck!</p>
