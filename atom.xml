<p></p>

<h2 id="misc">Misc.</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-integrate-python-and-r-in-visual-studio-code-496a47c90422">How to integrate Python and R in Visual Studio Code</a>. I really like VSCode, but I always have issues with how to configure for Python and R when installing from scratch.

</ul>

<h2 id="wind-what-is-niels-doing">WIND (What Is Niels Doing)</h2>

<p>In <a href="/2020/11/08/interesting-stuff---week-45-2020/">last weeks roundup</a> I wrote about my recording of video for the Data Platform Summit 2020.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/dps_2020.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If I haven&rsquo;t said it before:</p>

<p>I am super excited to be speaking at the <a href="https://dataplatformgeeks.com/dps2020/"><strong>Data Platform Virtual Summit 2020</strong></a>. A 100% technical learning event with 200 Breakout Sessions, 30 Training Classes, 72 hours of non-stop conference sessions – DPS 2020 is the largest online learning event on Microsoft Azure Data, Analytics &amp; Artificial Intelligence. Delegates get the recordings at no extra cost, which is quite a wonderful thing. Also, the conference virtual platform looks amazing, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/amitbansal2010_dps2020-sqlserver-powerbi-activity-6728885748755374080-a8QL/">take a look</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to attend and hear industry experts talk about really exciting stuff you can <a href="https://dataplatformgeeks.com/dps2020/booking/">book here</a>. Oh, and the coolest thing is that as I am a speaker I get a discount code to hand out to you guys!

<p>This blog-post is the &ldquo;roundup&rdquo; of the things that have been most interesting to me, for the week just ending.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="big-data">Big Data</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2020/11/02/helios-part-ii/">Helios: hyperscale indexing for the cloud &amp; edge (part II)</a>. In last weeks <a href="/2020/11/01/interesting-stuff---week-44-2020/">roundup</a>, I pointed to a post by <a href="https://twitter.com/adriancolyer">Adrian</a>, where he dissected a white-paper about Helios, and I said how I looked forward to part 2. Well, I got what I wanted, and the post I link to here is the follow-up. Enjoy!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="distributed-computing">Distributed Computing</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://vlfig.me/posts/microservices">Microservices — architecture nihilism in minimalism&rsquo;s clothes</a>. This post looks at microservices and argues that there is no such thing as a microservice architecture, but software architecture. The author also looks at the size of a microservice and argues that there is no prescribed size of a microservice. I found the post very interesting!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://itnext.io/change-data-capture-with-azure-postgresql-and-kafka-4598dbf0b57a">Change Data Capture with Azure, PostgreSQL, and Kafka</a>. In this blog post, the author looks at how one can use Change Data Capture to stream database modifications from PostgreSQL to Azure Data Explorer, (Kusto), using Apache Kafka. It is an interesting post! As a side note, I must say that Azure Data Explorer looks really interesting!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/pull-queries-in-preview-confluent-cloud-ksqdb/">Announcing Pull Queries in Preview in Confluent Cloud ksqlDB</a>. ksqlDB has two types of queries: push and pull. Push queries allow you subscribe to a query&rsquo;s result as it changes in real-time, whereas with a pull query you fetch the current state of a materialized view. Both types of queries have been in Confluent Platform for a while, but Confluent Cloud has up until now only supported push queries. That changes now, and the post I linked to here discusses more in detail about the support for pull queries in Confluent Cloud.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="wind-what-is-niels-doing">WIND (What Is Niels Doing)</h2>

<p>Well, it is not so much about what I am doing, as it is of what I have been doing the last couple of days. You who read my blog are probably aware that:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/Niels_Berglund.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> <em>SQL Server &amp; Kafka</em></p>

<p>Yes, I am speaking at the conference! My topic is about, as you can see in <em>Figure 1</em>, the various ways we can stream data from SQL Server to Apache Kafka. In a previous roundup, I wrote how I was prepping for the talk. That is all good and well, but a while ago a &ldquo;curve-ball&rdquo; was thrown: the conference is obviously virtual, but: we are not presenting live! Which means that the last few days, I have been recording, and editing the recording. Geez, recording and editing is hard work, compared to &ldquo;just&rdquo; deliver. Well, it is done now, and if you <a href="https://dataplatformgeeks.com/dps2020/booking/https://dataplatformgeeks.com/dps2020/booking/">register</a> you have the chance to see other speakers and me in a recorded fashion.</p>

In this post <a href="https://twitter.com/adriancolyer">Adrian</a> from the <a href="https://blog.acolyer.org">morning paper</a> dissects a white-paper about Helios. Helios is a distributed, highly-scalable system used at Microsoft for flexible ingestion, indexing, and aggregation of large streams of real-time data that is designed to plug into relational engines. Adrian is as thorough as usual, and the conclusions he draws are very interesting. I can&rsquo;t wait for part 2.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="distributed-systems">Distributed Systems</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@polyglot_factotum/how-i-am-learning-distributed-systems-7eb69b4b51bd">How I am learning distributed systems</a>. This post looks, from one person&rsquo;s perspective, how one can learn to design distributed systems. What is interesting in this post is the use of <a href="https://raft.github.io/">Raft</a>, (no, not Raft the game - but the consensus algorithm), as a learning tool. I will definitely point to this post as a learning resource for my developers.</li>
<li><a href="https://thenewstack.io/nginx-steps-into-the-service-mesh-fray-promising-a-simpler-alternative/">NGINX Steps into the Service Mesh Fray Promising a Simpler Alternative</a>. The post linked to here points discusses how NGINX introduces its own service mesh: <a href="https://www.nginx.com/products/nginx-service-mesh">NGINX Service Mesh</a>, (NSM). It promises to be less complicated than ISTIO, so I will definitely have a look.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/how-to-prepare-for-kip-500-kafka-zookeeper-removal-guide/">Preparing Your Clients and Tools for KIP-500: ZooKeeper Removal from Apache Kafka</a>. The Kafka community has for quite a while been talking about removing the dependency of ZooKeeper, (ZK), from Kafka, and it seems we are getting closer. In the post I have linked to here, the author looks at what is needed to do in Kafka consumers so that nothing &ldquo;bad&rdquo; happens when ZK is eventually removed.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.kai-waehner.de/blog/2020/10/27/streaming-machine-learning-kafka-native-model-server-deployment-rpc-embedded-streams/">Streaming Machine Learning with Kafka-native Model Deployment</a>. Kafka is used more and more for real-time machine learning purposes, and we are moving towards Kafka as a native streaming model server. This blog post explores the architectures and trade-offs between various options for model deployment with Kafka.</li>

<h2 id="sql-server-2019-big-data-cluster">SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://mohammaddarab.com/stop-and-start-your-aks-big-data-cluster-and-save-money/">Stop and Start your AKS Big Data Cluster and Save $$$</a>. In this post, my good friend <a href="https://twitter.com/mwdarab">Mohammad</a> looks at new functionality in Azure Kubernetes Service, (AKS), whereby you can start and stop Kubernetes clusters at will. Mohammad looks at it from the perspective of SQL Server 2019 Big Data Clusters running in AKS.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/data-rocks/kafka-record-tracing-379ed2b0af51">Kafka record tracing</a>. Do you know how long it takes for messages to flow in your data pipeline? Do you know where the bottlenecks are? Why I ask these questions is that in a distributed system, the answers may not always be that easy to find. The post linked to here looks at solutions to these questions, and it looks at distributed tracing for Kafka.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/kafka-cluster-linking-with-confluent-platform/">Introducing Cluster Linking in Confluent Platform 6.0</a>. As the title of this post says, the post is about linking Kafka clusters to each other. From the post: &ldquo;Replicating topics between Kafka clusters has been a long-standing problem that’s seen a number of solutions, including MirrorMaker and Confluent Replicator. Although the utility of these projects has come a long way, they’re not without their respective issues.&rdquo;. The issues referred to in the previous sentence, is what the new cluster linking functionality is supposed to fix. It looks very promising, the one question I have right now is if this is a Confluent Platform Enterprise only functionality?</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/data-rocks/managing-kafka-connectors-at-scale-using-kafka-connect-manager-kcm-31d887de033c">Managing Kafka Connectors at scale using Kafka Connect Manager</a>. A while back we, (<a href="/derivco">Derivco</a>), looked at using CDC and Debezium to get data out from the database to Kafka. One of the problems we faced was how to manage the various Kafka Connectors, and ensure they were functioning correctly. The post I link to here would have been the perfect solution for us - a framework for managing Kafka Connectors. It would be interesting to know if it is open-sourced.</li>

<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/confluent-platform-6-0-delivers-the-most-powerful-event-streaming-platform-to-date/">Introducing Confluent Platform 6.0</a>. As the title of this post says; the post is about the new 6.0 release of Confluent Platform. Reading the post, this release looks huge. There are so many interesting things in there, but the ones that stand out for me are the ksqlDB improvements! For more information about the new ksqlDB functionality, look at the post <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/ksqldb-0-12-0-features-updates/">ksqlDB 0.12.0 Introduces Real-Time Query Upgrades and Automatic Query Restarts</a>. This is awesome!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/how-real-time-stream-processing-works-with-ksqldb/">How Real-Time Stream Processing Works with ksqlDB, Animated</a>. While we are on the subject of ksqlDB, this post is doing a great job how ksqlDB works. If you are interested in ksqlDB at all, you must read the post!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/ksqldb-java-client-iot-inspired-demo/">ksqlDB Meets Java: An IoT-Inspired Demo of the Java Client for ksqlDB</a>. Even more ksqlDB. The post linked to here looks at the new ksqlDB Java client. So, instead of using REST API&rsquo;s, you can now do ksqlDB &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; programmatically, using this new client, That is very, very interesting!</li>

<h2 id="wind-what-is-niels-doing">WIND (What Is Niels Doing)</h2>

<p>Yes, what AM I doing? Sometimes, quite often actually, I wonder that myself. Today, however, I do know what I am doing, or more specifically, what I just did! Yesterday, (October 3), I delivered a virtual conference talk at SQLBits about SQL Server and Kafka.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the talk was pre-recorded, and after I had uploaded the recording, the organizers did some editing. I messed up with what parts of the talk needed editing, so the result was that around a third of the talk was missing. Not good! Anyway, the organizers will do a re-edit and upload so that attendees can view it on demand. If you were one of the attendees, I do apologize again!</p>

<p>Anyway, today I uploaded the slide deck as well as all code for the talk, (including instructions). If you are interested, you can download it from <a href="https://nielsberglund.com/download/set-data-free-kafka.zip">here</a>. If you have questions comments etc., please <a href="mailto:niels.it.berglund@gmail.com">ping me</a>.</p>

<h2 id="finally">~ Finally</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. If you have ideas for what to cover, please comment on this post or <a href="mailto:niels.it.berglund@gmail.com">ping</a> me.</p>]]></content>

</ul>

<h2 id="wind-what-is-niels-doing">WIND (What Is Niels Doing)</h2>

<p>In <a href="/2020/09/06/interesting-stuff---week-36-2020/">last weeks roundup</a> I said how I was going to do a <strong>Derivco Webinar</strong> this week about <strong>SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster</strong>. Well, I did it September 10, it went off without a &ldquo;hitch&rdquo;, and - if I can say it myself - it was a lot of fun.

<li><a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/">Patterns of Distributed Systems</a>. This article came to my attention thanks to a colleague of mine - thanks, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-dukes-aaa49154/">Scott</a>!

<p>Wow! We are already in July - where has the first part of the year gone? Let&rsquo;s hope that the rest of the year will be better than the first half!</p>

<p>So, in last week&rsquo;s <a href="/2020/06/28/interesting-stuff---week-26-2020/">roundup</a>, I wrote these are nervous times right now, as it is MVP renewal time. The renewals should happen Wednesday, July 1st. I can say I was not that productive that day, as I mostly refreshed my email client to see whether there was an email saying if I were renewed or not.</p>

<p>The day dragged on, and I heard from some of my fellow MVP&rsquo;s how they had received their renewal emails - that did not make me feel any better, and then I received this:</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> <em>MVP Renewal</em></p>

<p>Phew, I am renewed for another year. Thank you, Microsoft!</p>

<p>Ok, enough about that. This week on Tuesday, (July 7th), the Azure User Group here in Durban have our monthly <em>News and Catchup</em> meeting. If you want to come and hang out, (virtually), the link is <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Azure-Transformation-Labs/events/271041672/">here</a>. See you Tuesday!</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. If you have ideas for what to cover, please comment on this post or <a href="mailto:niels.it.berglund@gmail.com">ping</a> me.</p>]]></content>
