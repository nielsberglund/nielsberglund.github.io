<li>data in general</li>
<li>distributed computing</li>
<li>SQL Server</li>
<li>transactions (both db as well as non db)</li>
<li>and other &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>This blog-post is the &ldquo;roundup&rdquo; of the things that have been most interesting to me, for the week just ending.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="distributed-computing">Distributed Computing</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/distributed-video-sharing-demo/">Distributed Programming, Hash Tables, and Fun!</a>. In this <a href="https://www.infoq.com/">InfoQ</a> presentation, the presenters demonstrate how they built a distributed hash-table video-sharing system, the technical hurdles encountered, and the pros/cons of using functional languages to do so. Very interesting!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="machine-learning">Machine Learning</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://becominghuman.ai/cheat-sheets-for-ai-neural-networks-machine-learning-deep-learning-big-data-678c51b4b463">Cheat Sheets for AI, Neural Networks, Machine Learning, Deep Learning &amp; Big Data</a>. Cheat sheets are good, and I certainly need them. The post linked to gives, according to the post, <em>the most complete list of best AI cheat sheets</em>. I don&rsquo;t know about that, but there are some quite cool cheat sheets in there.</li>
<li><a href="https://dalelane.co.uk/blog/?p=4124">Using TensorFlow to make predictions from Kafka events</a>. This is a very interesting post, looking at how you can use Kafka and TensorFlow together to make machine learning predictions around sensor events.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/prioritize-messages-in-kafka/">Implementing Message Prioritization in Apache Kafka</a>. This post came at the exact right time, as I have been battling with how to implement priority messages in Kafka. In Rabbit, which we used previously, it was easy. In Kafka not so much. So reading about &ldquo;bucketing&rdquo; saved the day!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="wind-what-is-niels-doing">WIND (What Is Niels Doing)</h2>

<p>In <a href="/2020/09/06/interesting-stuff---week-36-2020/">last weeks roundup</a> I said how I was going to do a <strong>Derivco Webinar</strong> this week about <strong>SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster</strong>. Well, I did it September 10, it went off without a &ldquo;hitch&rdquo;, and - if I can say it myself - it was a lot of fun. If you are interested in seeing it, you find it on the Derivco YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyCsQP5VJhU">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="finally">~ Finally</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. If you have ideas for what to cover, please comment on this post or <a href="mailto:niels.it.berglund@gmail.com">ping</a> me.</p>]]></content>

<p>Wow! We are already in July - where has the first part of the year gone? Let&rsquo;s hope that the rest of the year will be better than the first half!</p>

<p>So, in last week&rsquo;s <a href="/2020/06/28/interesting-stuff---week-26-2020/">roundup</a>, I wrote these are nervous times right now, as it is MVP renewal time. The renewals should happen Wednesday, July 1st. I can say I was not that productive that day, as I mostly refreshed my email client to see whether there was an email saying if I were renewed or not.</p>

<p>The day dragged on, and I heard from some of my fellow MVP&rsquo;s how they had received their renewal emails - that did not make me feel any better, and then I received this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/mvp-2020.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> <em>MVP Renewal</em></p>

<p>Phew, I am renewed for another year. Thank you, Microsoft!</p>

<p>Ok, enough about that. This week on Tuesday, (July 7th), the Azure User Group here in Durban have our monthly <em>News and Catchup</em> meeting. If you want to come and hang out, (virtually), the link is <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Azure-Transformation-Labs/events/271041672/">here</a>. See you Tuesday!</p>

As the title says, the post announces the open-sourcing of the Spark Connector for SQL Server. From the post: <em>The Apache Spark Connector for SQL Server and Azure SQL is a high-performance connector that enables you to use transactional data in big data analytics and persists results for ad-hoc queries or reporting. The connector allows you to use any SQL database, on-premises or in the cloud, as an input data source or output data sink for Spark jobs.</em> This is very, very cool!</li>

As you probably know, I have an interest in SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster. One of the questions that often come up is if one can run it on RedHat OpenShift, and the answer to that has been no, you cannot. That is until now, with the release of SQL Server cumulative update 5, (CU5). The post linked to here discusses it more in detail. Watch this space for a post about how to install the BDC on the RedHat OpenShift platform.</li>

<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/unifying-streams-and-state-seamless-path-to-real-time/">Unifying Streams and State: The Seamless Path to Real-Time</a>. This post and the accompanying video looks at how easy it is to do stream processing applications with Confluent Cloud and ksqlDB. Very cool!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="wind-what-is-niels-doing">WIND (What Is Niels Doing)</h2>

<p>These are nervous times! No, not because of COVID-19, but something much more serious: it is renewal time for MVP! July first all MVP&rsquo;s will know whether they have been renewed for another year. I have a funny feeling that I haven&rsquo;t done enough, but I guess we&rsquo;ll see on Wednesday!</p>

<p>As I wrote in the <a href="/2020/05/31/interesting-stuff---week-22-2020/">roundup from last week</a>, lockdown restrictions here in SA have been relaxed, a bit. That means that you can now exercise whenever you want, instead of between 06:00 - 10:00 am; yay!, (that was sarcasm). For me, nothing has really changed, and I do not think I&rsquo;ll be back in the office until July/August.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Azure-Transformation-Labs/">Durban Azure Transformation Labs</a> user group, we had the first monthly News &amp; Catchup meeting. This meeting is virtual, and we get together the first Tuesday every month chatting about what has happened in the industry during the month just gone by. If you are interested in what was said, the recording of the event 10 is up on YouTube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxLQOaEnCqY">News &amp; Catch up June 2020</a>.</p>

<p>This blog-post is the &ldquo;roundup&rdquo; of the things that have been most interesting to me, for the week just ending.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="misc">Misc.</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/05/microsoft-build-2020-highlights/">Microsoft Build 2020: Highlights</a>. A couple of weeks ago Microsoft held its annual developer conference, Build. Due to the pandemic, it was a virtual 48 hour, around the clock conference, and it was free. The article linked to here is an <a href="https://www.infoq.com/">InfoQ</a> article listing noteworthy &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; from the conference. As a side note: I wonder how much changes we will see in the conference landscape after when this pandemic is over. Will there be &ldquo;on-prem&rdquo; conferences any more, or will most conferences go virtual?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="big-data">Big Data</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/apache-arrow-java">Apache Arrow and Java: Lightning Speed Big Data Transfer</a>. So Apache Arrow is a cross-language, cross-platform, columnar in-memory data format for data. The <a href="https://www.infoq.com/">InfoQ</a> article linked to here introduces Apache Arrow and gets you acquainted with the basic concepts of the Apache Arrow Java library. If you&rsquo;re not a Java developer, don&rsquo;t worry - Apache Arrow offers libraries for many other languages as well: C, C++, C#, Go, to name a few.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="machine-learning">Machine Learning</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://databricks.com/blog/2020/05/27/modernizing-risk-management-part-1-streaming-data-ingestion-rapid-model-development-and-monte-carlo-simulations-at-scale.html">Modernizing Risk Management Part 1: Streaming data-ingestion, rapid model development and Monte-Carlo Simulations at Scale</a>. This blog post demonstrates how to modernize traditional value-at-risk (VaR) calculation. It is demonstrated in the post, by using various components of the Databricks Unified Data Analytics Platform — Delta Lake, Apache SparkTM and MLflow. This enables a more agile and forward-looking approach to risk management.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/clickstream-data-and-analytics-with-confluent-ksqldb-kafka-connect/">Building a Clickstream Dashboard Application with ksqlDB and Elasticsearch</a>. This post shows an example of how you can build an event-driven application to help you unlock insights contained in the event streams of your business. As the title implies, Kafka, ksqlDB, and Elasticsearch are the components used. Very cool post!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/secure-kafka-deployment-best-practices/">Best Practices to Secure Your Apache Kafka Deployment</a>. So you are building your event streaming platform on Kafka - awesome! When you are ready to go live, your &ldquo;pesky&rdquo; security department asks you about security: &ldquo;how is the data that flows through Kafka secure, what have you done to prevent data breaches?&rdquo;. Trust me, they will ask you! Fear not, the post I link to here reviews five security categories and the essential features of Kafka and Confluent Platform that enable you to secure your event streaming platform. If you work with Kafka, <strong>READ</strong> the post!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSyNiEgEyvY">Derivco Webinar - Kafka Masterclass</a>. As I mentioned in last weeks roundup, <a href="https://twitter.com/charllamprecht">Charl Lamprecht</a>, and I were going to do a <a href="/derivco">Derivco</a> Webinar about Kafka: <strong>Conquer Your Data with Kafka and ksqlDB</strong>. Well, we did it, and the link here is to the uploaded YouTube video. Both <a href="https://twitter.com/charllamprecht">Charl</a> and I had a blast, and we believe the webinar was a success - peak attendance was at around 700 attendees</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="wind-what-is-niels-doing">WIND (What Is Niels Doing)</h2>

<p>Still lockdown! Apparently, some of the lockdown restrictions will be eased June 1, but I don&rsquo;t see me being back in the office for at least a month, most likely two.</p>

<p>As I mentioned above, I did the <a href="/derivco">Derivco</a> Kafka <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSyNiEgEyvY">webinar</a> last week together with <a href="https://twitter.com/charllamprecht">Charl</a>, and we had a great time.</p>

<p>I am still working on the follow-up to the <a href="/2020/04/26/a-lap-around-sql-server-2019-big-data-cluster-background--technology/"><strong>A Lap Around SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster: Background &amp; Technology</strong></a> post.

<p>Our local <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Azure-Transformation-Labs/">Azure Meetup group</a> has a virtual catchup on Tuesday, (June 1), where we discuss any news or anything interesting that came out in May 2020 in the industry. If you are interested, please register <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Azure-Transformation-Labs/events/270811782/?rv=ce1&amp;_xtd=gatlbWFpbF9jbGlja9oAJDA1NDZiYjMxLTUzZjAtNDQwOS05YmQ0LTIzMGEyYTg4NjEwZg&amp;_af=event&amp;_af_eid=270811782">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="distributed-computing">Distributed Computing</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2020/05/slog-serializable-low-latency-geo.html">SLOG: serializable, low-latency, geo-replicated transactions</a>. In this blog post <a href="https://twitter.com/muratdemirbas">Murat</a> dissects a white paper about how one can in a distributed system avoid the tradeoff of giving up one of serializability, low latency writes, or high transactional throughput. <a href="https://twitter.com/muratdemirbas">Murat</a> does a great job dissecting a complex topic and make it understandable.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sql-server">SQL Server</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/machine-learning-extension?view=sql-server-ver15">Machine Learning extension (preview) for Azure Data Studio</a>.

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ververica.com/blog/how-godaddy-uses-flink-to-run-real-time-streaming-pipelines">How GoDaddy uses Flink to run real time streaming pipelines</a>. This post, as the title says, looks at data pipelines at GoDaddy, and how they use Apache Flink in conjunction with other tools to create and run those pipelines. What I found especially interesting in the post was the description of how they deployed a new pipeline into production. That is something I will copy and try to implement at <a href="/derivco">Derivco</a>.</li>

Usually, this course costs $2,500, but now - due to the pandemic - it is free! Udi is an excellent instructor, and as one of my colleagues said: <em>as apposed to other so-called experts, there is none of this &ldquo;tear down, and build up&rdquo; bullsh%t.</em></li>
<li><a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/05/monolith-decomposition-newman">Decomposing a Monolith Does Not Require Microservices - Sam Newman at QCon London</a>.

<li><a href="https://medium.com/distributed-knowledge/paxos-consensus-for-beginners-1b8519d3360f">Paxos consensus for beginners</a>. The post here tries to explain Paxos. Paxos is a consensus algorithm, and most other consensus algorithms, such as Raft, ZAB, etc., are based on Paxos. So I said that the post tries to explain Paxos, and in my mind, the author succeeds!</li>

This is a thought-provoking article looking at if Kafka can be considered a database. My thoughts around that are - it depends. It depends on what functionality you expect a database to have. So, to me, I&rsquo;d say Kafka is close, really close, but I would like to see the ability to do range queries against some other field(s) than the <code>ROWKEY</code> field before I consider Kafka a database.</li>

<p>This blog-post is the &ldquo;roundup&rdquo; of the things that have been most interesting to me, for the week just ending.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="misc">Misc.</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://mybuild.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Build</a>. The COVID-19 virus impacts everything, not least conferences, with many conferences canceled. Fortunately, some conferences go virtual, and Microsoft Build 2020 is one of them. The link here is to the registration for MS Build 2020, and it is free! Yes, you read that right - MS Build is free! I, for one, have already signed up. Hope to see you there!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="data-science">Data Science</h2>

From the title of the post, you get what it covers. <a href="https://twitter.com/revodavid">David</a> from [Revolution Analytics] looks at what is new in the recently released R 4.0, and he also takes a look back at the history of R.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>

<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/broadcom-uses-ksqldb-to-modernize-machine-learning-anomaly-detection/">Broadcom Modernizes Machine Learning and Anomaly Detection with ksqlDB</a>. The post linked to here is a very cool example of how we can use Kafka and ksqlDB together with Machine Learning for a lot of interesting topics (pun intended). In this particular case for anomaly detection.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ververica.com/blog/flink-forward-virtual-2020-recap">Flink Forward Virtual 2020 Recap</a>. Above I wrote about the upcoming MS Build virtual conference. The post here is a look at a virtual conference that already has taken place: the Flink Forward 2020 conference. The post has links to the session recordings as well as the slide decks.

</ul>

<h2 id="wind-what-is-niels-doing">WIND (What Is Niels Doing)</h2>

<p>In previous roundups, I have written about the lock-down here in SA. Well, the lock-down was initially supposed to end mid-April, but it was extended to end of April. However, the lock-down is not over, as it has now moved from stage 5, to stage 4. That changes almost nothing, i.e. you are still supposed to stay at home. What has changed is that restaurants are allowed to deliver, so this Friday, (May 1), I had pizza for the first time in a month, yum!</p>

<p>The other thing that has changed being in stage 4 is that online businesses can sell, (and deliver), computer &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;. So right now I am waiting on a delivery of a new keyboard and mouse, so I am happy! The little things in life - eh?!</p>

<p>Finally, the first-ever SQL Server 2019 Virtual Symposium happens May 7 - 8. Don&rsquo;t miss the chance to hear the likes of <a href="https://twitter.com/bobwardms">Bob Ward</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/BuckWoodyMSFT">Buck Woody</a> present awesome stuff! I had hoped to present as well, but this time it was not to be. I will, however, attend, and I suggest you do likewise. The symposium is arranged by <a href="https://www.dataplatformgeeks.com/"><strong>DataPlatformGeeks</strong></a>, and you can register <a href="https://www.dataplatformgeeks.com/virtual-symposium-sql-server-2019-may-2020/">here</a>.</p>
