    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft introduced the ability to call Java code from SQL Server in around the SQL Server 2019 CTP 2.0 release, and I have written some posts posts about this:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/s2k19_ext_framework_java"><strong>SQL Server 2019 Extensibility Framework &amp; Java</strong></a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Throughout the CTP releases some functionality has changed, and in CTP 2.5 Microsoft introduced the Java Language Extension SDK. The Java code we write needs now to include the Java SDK and extend an abstract base from the SDK.</p>

<p>With the introduction of the Java Language SDK, came some changes to how you handle method parameters, and I touched upon it briefly in the <a href="/2019/05/26/java--sql-server-2019-extensibility-framework-the-sequel/"><strong>Java &amp; SQL Server 2019 Extensibility Framework: The Sequel</strong></a> post. In this post, I want to look more in detail at parameters and how to handle them.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> <em>This post contains Java code. I am not a Java guy, in fact, the only Java I have ever written is the code for the SQL Server 2019 Java posts. So, the code is not elegant in any shape or form, and I am absolutely certain it can be done in a much better way. However, this is not about Java as such, but how you call Java code from SQL Server, and what you need to implement on the Java side.</em></p>

<h2 id="java-code-in-sql-refresh">Java Code in SQL Refresh</h2>

<p>If you have not done any Java code in SQL Server, or at least not recently, here are some posts which introduce you to Java in SQL Server:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/2019/03/10/sql-server-2019-java--external-libraries---i/"><strong>SQL Server 2019, Java &amp; External Libraries - I</strong></a>. Part I of a couple of posts where we look at how we can deploy Java code to the database, so it can be loaded from there.</li>
<li><a href="/2019/05/26/java--sql-server-2019-extensibility-framework-the-sequel/"><strong>Java &amp; SQL Server 2019 Extensibility Framework: The Sequel</strong></a>. We look at the implications of the introduction of the Java Language Extension SDK.</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="pre-req">Pre-req</h2>

<p>If you want to follow along with what we are doing in this post, you need:</p>

<ul>
<li>A SQL Server 2019 CTP 3.0, (or later), instance.</li>
<li>A database where you have registered Java as a language. Read <a href="/2019/06/06/sql-server-2019-extensibility-framework--external-languages/">this post</a> if you are unsure how to register Java as an external language.</li>
<li>The Java Language SDK deployed to the database above. <a href="/2019/05/26/java--sql-server-2019-extensibility-framework-the-sequel/">This post</a> explains how.</li>
<li>Understand how to deploy Java code to the database. The post <a href="/2019/03/10/sql-server-2019-java--external-libraries---i/">here</a> helps with that.</li>
</ul>

<p>You also need an editor with which you can write Java code. I am partial to <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> myself, and I wrote a post about VS Code and Java <a href="/2019/01/17/sql-server-2019--java-with-visual-studio-code/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="parameter-recap">Parameter Recap</h2>

<p>Let us take a look back at parameters to refresh our memory.</p>

<h4 id="bjlsdk-before-java-language-sdk">BJLSDK (Before Java Language SDK)</h4>

<p>Before the introduction of the Java Language SDK, (before CTP 2.5), you called into a method specified in the <code>@script</code> variable of the <code>sp_execute_external_script</code>, (SPEES), procedure. You defined the parameters you wanted to send to the Java code as class variables with the same name as the SQL parameters but without the <code>@</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">DECLARE @p1 int = 21;
DECLARE @p2 int = 21;
EXEC sp_execute_external_script
  @language = N'Java'
, @script = N'JavaTest1.adder'
, @params = N'@x int, @y int'
, @x = @p1
, @y = @p2   
GO
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 1</strong> <em>Call from T-SQL to Java with Parameters</em></p>

<p>We see in <em>Code Snippet 1</em> how we want to call into the <code>adder</code> method in the <code>JavaTest1</code> class, passing in two parameters: <code>@x</code>, and <code>@y</code>. When we execute the code the Java C++ language extension gets the parameter values, and looks in the code for two class-level variables named <code>x</code>, and <code>y</code>, and assigns the values to those variables. The <code>adder</code> method then uses <code>x</code>, and <code>y</code>.</p>

<h4 id="ajlsdk-after-java-language-sdk">AJLSDK (After Java Language SDK)</h4>

<p>I mentioned above how a couple of things changed after Microsoft introduced the Java Language SDK. One of them was that you no longer define a method in SPEES&rsquo;s <code>@script</code> parameter. The parameter instead defines a class you want to call into.</p>

<p>The class must extend the <code>AbstractSqlServerExtensionExecutor</code> abstract base class and implement the <code>execute</code> method from the base class. The <code>execute</code> method is the method the Java C++ language extension calls into, and the signature looks like so:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">public AbstractSqlServerExtensionDataset execute(
                                AbstractSqlServerExtensionDataset input, 
                                LinkedHashMap&lt;String, Object&gt; params) {
  throw new UnsupportedOperationException(&quot;AbstractSqlServerExtensionExecutor 
                                          execute() is not implemented&quot;);
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 2</strong> <em>The <code>execute</code> Method</em></p>

<p>From the signature in <em>Code Snippet 2</em> we see how the <code>execute</code> method takes two parameters and has a return type.</p>

<p>To call into Java after the introduction of the Java Language SDK has not changed much:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">DECLARE @p1 int = 21;
DECLARE @p2 int = 21;
EXEC sp_execute_external_script
  @language = N'Java'
, @script = N'sql.JavaTest1'
, @params = N'@x int, @y int'
, @x = @p1
, @y = @p2   
GO
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 3:</strong> <em>Call from T-SQL to Java with Parameters</em></p>

<p>The only real difference between <em>Code Snippet 3</em> and <em>Code Snippet 2</em> is that the <code>@script</code> parameter is now <code>package.class</code>, instead of <code>class.method</code>.</p>

<p>For the parameters the Java C++ language extension creates a new instance of a <code>LinkedHashMap</code> and populates it with the parameter names, (sans <code>@</code>), and the values.</p>

<h2 id="parameters">Parameters</h2>

<p>Having the recap out of the way, let us see how we handle the parameters in our Java code. Let us first start with some skeleton code:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">package sql;

import com.microsoft.sqlserver.javalangextension.*;
import java.util.LinkedHashMap;

public class JavaTest1 extends AbstractSqlServerExtensionExecutor {

  public JavaTest1() {
    executorExtensionVersion = SQLSERVER_JAVA_LANG_EXTENSION_V1;
    executorInputDatasetClassName = PrimitiveDataset.class.getName();
    executorOutputDatasetClassName = PrimitiveDataset.class.getName();
  }

  public PrimitiveDataset execute(PrimitiveDataset input, 
                                  LinkedHashMap&lt;String, Object&gt; params) {
    
    return null;

  }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 4:</strong> <em>Java Starter Code</em></p>

<p>We see in <em>Code Snippet 4</em> that we have a class, <code>JavaTest1</code>, which extends the <code>AbstractSqlServerExtensionExecutor</code> class. In the constructor, we set some required class members, and the <code>execute</code> method is empty.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The post <a href="/2019/05/26/java--sql-server-2019-extensibility-framework-the-sequel/"><strong>Java &amp; SQL Server 2019 Extensibility Framework: The Sequel</strong></a> explains about the constructor in <em>Code Snippet 4</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The code we want to write is to handle the parameters we send in when we execute the code in <em>Code Snippet 3</em>, and in our code, we want to add the two parameters together. With that in mind, our code looks like so:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">public PrimitiveDataset execute(PrimitiveDataset input, 
                                LinkedHashMap&lt;String, Object&gt; params) {

  int x = (int)params.get(&quot;x&quot;);
  int y = (int)params.get(&quot;y&quot;);
  System.out.printf(&quot;The result of adding %d and %d = %d&quot;, x, y, x + y);
  return null;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 5:</strong> <em>Handle Parameters</em></p>

<p>We see in <em>Code Snippet 5</em> how we handle the parameters that come in from SQL Server:</p>

<ul>
<li>As we said above, the Java C++ language extension populates the <code>LinkedHashMap</code> with the parameters from SQL Server, so we retrieve the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> using the <code>get</code> method. As the <code>get</code> method returns an object, we cast it to <code>int</code>.</li>
<li>We then add <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> together and we call <code>printf</code> to show the result.</li>
</ul>

<p>After we compile and package the code into a <code>.jar</code> file we deploy to our database:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">CREATE EXTERNAL LIBRARY SqlParamLib 
FROM (CONTENT = 'W:\sql-params-1.0.jar')
WITH (LANGUAGE = 'Java');
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 6:</strong> <em>Deploy to the Database</em></p>

<p>From <em>Code Snippet 6</em> we see how I deploy to my SQL Server based on a file-path: <code>W:\sql-params-1.0.jar</code>, and how I indicate that what I deploy is Java code: <code>LANGUAGE = 'Java'</code>. The post <a href="/2019/03/10/sql-server-2019-java--external-libraries---i/"><strong>SQL Server 2019, Java &amp; External Libraries - I</strong></a> covers in detail how to deploy Java code to SQL Server.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I can use a file path when I deploy as my SQL Server is on my local machine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When we have deployed as in <em>Code Snippet 6</em> we execute the code in <em>Code Snippet 3</em>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/sql-2k19-java-params-add.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> <em>Add Result</em></p>

<p>In <em>Figure 1</em> we see that our code worked, cool!</p>

<h4 id="null-values">Null Values</h4>

<p>Now then, what if one of the parameters in <em>Code Snippet 3</em> is not <code>DECLARE</code>:ed and set, but instead generated by something, (perhaps a <code>SELECT</code>), and it doesn&rsquo;t have a value:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">DECLARE @p1 int;
DECLARE @p2 int;

SELECT @p1 = null, @p2 = 21;

EXEC sp_execute_external_script
  @language = N'Java'
, @script = N'sql.JavaTest1'
, @params = N'@x int, @y int'
, @x = @p1
, @y = @p2   
GO
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 7:</strong> <em>Null Parameter</em></p>

<p>In <em>Code Snippet 7</em> we see how we retrieve the values of the two parameters, and one is null, (no value). Let us see what happens when we execute the code:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/sql-2k19-java-params-null.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 2:</strong> <em>Null Parameter</em></p>

<p>Hmm, not good, we get a <code>NullPointerException</code> as we see in <em>Figure 2</em>. As a Java developer, this is what you would expect, whereas if we executed similar code in T-SQL, it would work - but the result would be <code>NULL</code>. I wrote <a href="/2019/10/26/sql-server-2019--java-null-handling-take-two/">here</a> about null handling in datasets, and how there is a &ldquo;convenience&rdquo; method <code>getColumnNullMap</code> which indicates null values for a column in the dataset.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we do not have the same for parameters, so we need to handle it ourselves. Since the parameter value&rsquo;s type in the <code>LinkedHashMap</code> is an <code>Object</code>, we should be able to do a null check quite easily before we do the cast. Alternatively, we can use the primitive type&rsquo;s wrapper class to accomplish the same thing:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">public PrimitiveDataset execute(PrimitiveDataset input, 
                                LinkedHashMap&lt;String, Object&gt; params) {

  boolean isNull = false;

  Integer x = (Integer)params.get(&quot;x&quot;);
  Integer y = (Integer)params.get(&quot;y&quot;);

  if(x == null || y == null) {
    isNull = true;
  }

  if(isNull) {
    String xStr = x != null ? x.toString() : &quot;null&quot;;
    String yStr = y != null ? y.toString() : &quot;null&quot;;
    System.out.printf(&quot;The result of adding %s and %s = %s&quot;, 
                       xStr, yStr, &quot;null&quot;);
  }
  else {
    System.out.printf(&quot;The result of adding %d and %d = %d&quot;, 
                       x, y, x + y);
  }

  return null;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 8:</strong> <em>Handle Null Parameter</em></p>

<p>In <em>Code Snippet 8</em> we see an example of how we can handle null parameters. As you see in the code snippet, we use the <code>Integer</code> wrapper class for <code>int</code>. Our logic is that if we get a null value, then the result should also be null.</p>

<h4 id="output-parameters">Output Parameters</h4>

<p>In SQL Server, when we execute a procedure, we can return values as output parameters, and the way we indicate that a parameter is for output is by using the <code>OUT</code> statement:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">DECLARE @p1 int = 21;
DECLARE @p2 int = 21;
DECLARE @ret int;
EXEC dbo.pr_MyAdder @x = @p1,
                    @y = @p2,
                    @retVal = @ret OUT;
SELECT @ret AS ReturnValue;                    
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 9:</strong> <em>Output Parameters - I</em></p>

<p>We see in <em>Code Snippet 9</em> how we assign <code>@ret</code> as an output parameter and then select the value after the execution of the procedure.</p>

<p>How do we do this in Java? Well, initially output parameters were not supported, but that changed with SQL Server CTP 3.0, (or 3.1). The reason why output parameters were not supported was that the Java C++ language extension did not have an implementation for output parameters. However, as I said above - that changed in CTP 3.0/3.1, and output parameters are now part of the <code>LinkedHashMap</code> parameter.</p>

<p>The Java C++ language extension populates, as I said above, the <code>LinkedHashMap</code> and since it is a reference type when the call returns the Java C++ language extension loops through the parameters and outputs the parameters adorned with <code>OUT</code>, (or <code>OUTPUT</code>).</p>

<p>The code to implement output parameters in our Java code looks like so:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">public PrimitiveDataset execute(PrimitiveDataset input, 
                                LinkedHashMap&lt;String, Object&gt; params) {

  boolean isNull = false;

  Integer x = (Integer)params.get(&quot;x&quot;);
  Integer y = (Integer)params.get(&quot;y&quot;);
  Integer retVal = (Integer)params.get(&quot;retVal&quot;);

  if(x == null || y == null) {
    isNull = true;
  }

  if(isNull) {
    params.put(&quot;retVal&quot;, null);
  }
  else {
    params.put(&quot;retVal&quot;, x + y);
  }

  return null;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 10:</strong> <em>Output Parameters in Java</em></p>

<p>We see in <em>Code Snippet 10</em> how we have changed the Java code to return the result of the addition of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> as an output parameter. We retrieve the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> values as before, and dependent on whether <code>x</code> or <code>y</code> is null or not we either <code>put</code> the <code>retVal</code> parameter as <code>null</code> or the result of the addition.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> It is not necessary to retrieve the <code>retVal</code> parameter as in <em>Code Snippet 10</em> since in this case, it is a pure output parameter. SQL Server, however, allows output parameters both to be used as in as out. So in your Java code, you may get a value coming in for an output parameter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The SQL code to execute against the code in <em>Code Snippet 10</em> looks like so:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">DECLARE @p1 int = 21;
DECLARE @p2 int = 21;
DECLARE @ret int;
EXEC sp_execute_external_script
  @language = N'Java'
, @script = N'sql.JavaTest1'
, @params = N'@x int, @y int, @retVal int OUT'
, @x = @p1
, @y = @p2  
, @retVal = @ret OUT;

SELECT @ret AS ReturnValue;
GO
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 11:</strong> <em>Output Parameters - II</em></p>

<p>We see in <em>Code Snippet 11</em> how we:</p>

<ul>
<li>Declare a third parameter<code>@ret</code>.</li>
<li>In the <code>@params</code> parameter we define the <code>@retVal</code> parameter.</li>
<li>Assign <code>@ret</code> to <code>@retVal</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The result of executing the code in <em>Code Snippet 11</em> is:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/sql-2k19-java-params-outputparam.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 3:</strong> <em>Output Parameter</em></p>

<p>As we see in <em>Figure 3</em> it works. If we were to send in null for <code>@x</code> or <code>@y</code>, we get back <code>NULL</code> in the <code>SELECT</code>.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>In this post, we saw how to handle parameters, and we said:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>LinkedHashMap</code> parameter in the <code>execute</code> method exposes parameters.</li>
<li>For primitive data type parameters, we can use Java&rsquo;s wrapper classes to handle null values.</li>
<li>The Java C++ language extension handles now output parameters.</li>
<li>We assign a value to an output parameter by doing a <code>put</code>.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You who read my blog know that during the last year, (or so), I have been writing about SQL Server 2019 and the ability to call into Java code from SQL Server:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/s2k19_ext_framework_java"><strong>SQL Server 2019 Extensibility Framework &amp; Java</strong></a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>It has been a fascinating &ldquo;journey&rdquo;, since SQL Server 2019 is still in preview, and there have been changes in how you call Java code along the way. In this post, we look at some relatively recent changes to how we handle null values in datasets.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="java-code-in-sql-refresh">Java Code in SQL Refresh</h2>

<p>If you have not done any Java code in SQL Server, or at least not recently, here are a couple of posts which introduces you to Java in SQL Server:</p>

<h4 id="data">Data</h4>

<p>In today&rsquo;s post, we use some data from the database. The code to insert the data is the same we used in a previous post: <a href="/2018/12/19/sql-server-2019-extensibility-framework--java---null-values/"><strong>SQL Server 2019 Extensibility Framework &amp; Java - Null Values</strong></a>:</p>

</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 1:</strong> <em>Create Database Objects</em></p>

<p>We see from *Code Snippet 1 * how we:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a database: <code>JavaNullDB</code>.</li>
<li>Create a table: <code>dbo.tb_NullRand10</code>.</li>
<li>Insert some data into the table.</li>
</ul>

<p>The data we insert is entirely random, but it gives us something to &ldquo;play around&rdquo; with.</p>

<p>Let us see what the data looks like, by executing: <code>SELECT RowID, x, y FROM dbo.tb_NullRand10;</code>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/sql-2k19-java-null2-result1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> <em>T-SQL Result</em></p>

<p>As we see in <em>Figure 1</em>, we get back 10 rows, and rows 3, 6, and 8 contains null values.</p>

<h4 id="enable-java-in-the-database">Enable Java in the Database</h4>

<p>To use Java in the database, you need to do a couple of more things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Register Java as an external language in your database. The following post describes what to do: <a href="/2019/06/06/sql-server-2019-extensibility-framework--external-languages/"><strong>SQL Server 2019 Extensibility Framework &amp; External Languages</strong></a>.</li>
<li>Create an external library in the database for the Java SDK. The post <a href="/2019/05/26/java--sql-server-2019-extensibility-framework-the-sequel/"><strong>Java &amp; SQL Server 2019 Extensibility Framework: The Sequel</strong></a> shows you how to do it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, when we have a database with some data and Java enabled we, can start.</p>

<h2 id="null-values">Null Values</h2>

<p>In the <a href="/2018/12/19/sql-server-2019-extensibility-framework--java---null-values/">null values post</a> mentioned above, I mentioned that there are differences between SQL Server and Java in how they handle null. So, when we call into Java from SQL Server, we may want to treat null values the same way as we do in SQL Server.</p>

<p>I wrote about this in the <a href="/2018/12/19/sql-server-2019-extensibility-framework--java---null-values/"><strong>SQL Server 2019 Extensibility Framework &amp; Java - Null Values</strong></a> post mentioned above. However, that post was written before SQL Server 2019 CTP 2.5. In CTP 2.5 Microsoft introduced the Java SDK, and certain things changed. Amongst the things that changed is the way we handle nulls when we receive datasets from SQL Server in our Java code.</p>

<p>Let us see how null handling works now post CTP 2.5. We use similar code to what we saw in the <a href="/2018/12/19/sql-server-2019-extensibility-framework--java---null-values/">null post</a> above:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">public PrimitiveDataset execute(PrimitiveDataset input, 
                               LinkedHashMap&lt;String, Object&gt; params) {
    
  int[] inputCol1 = input.getIntColumn(0);
  int[] inputCol2 = input.getIntColumn(1);
  int[] inputCol3 = input.getIntColumn(2);

  PrimitiveDataset output = new PrimitiveDataset();

  output.addColumnMetadata(0, &quot;RowID&quot;, Types.INTEGER, 0, 0);
  output.addColumnMetadata(1, &quot;x&quot;, Types.INTEGER, 0, 0);
  output.addColumnMetadata(2, &quot;y&quot;, Types.INTEGER, 0, 0);

  output.addIntColumn(0, inputCol1, null);
  output.addIntColumn(1, inputCol2, null);
  output.addIntColumn(2, inputCol3, null);
 
  return output;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 2:</strong> <em>Java Input &amp; Output Data</em></p>

<p>The code in <em>Code Snippet 3</em> &ldquo;echoes&rdquo; back what it receives as input dataset and we see how we:</p>

<ul>
<li>Load three arrays with the three columns in the dataset.</li>
<li>Create a new <code>PrimitiveDataset</code> to use as the return type.</li>
<li>Set metadata for the return dataset.</li>
<li>Assign the columns for the return dataset.</li>
<li>Return the dataset.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you wonder about why the method is named <code>execute</code> and what the <code>PrmitiveDataset</code> is; the post <a href="/2019/05/26/java--sql-server-2019-extensibility-framework-the-sequel/">here</a> explains it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After we have compiled and packaged the code into a <code>.jar</code> file we can deploy:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">CREATE EXTERNAL LIBRARY SqlNullLib 
FROM (CONTENT = 'W:\sql-null-1.0.jar')
WITH (LANGUAGE = 'Java');
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 3:</strong> <em>Deploy Java Code</em></p>

<p>As we see in <em>Code Snippet 3</em> I named my <code>.jar</code> file <code>sql-null-1.0.jar</code> and I deployed it as an external library: <code>SqlNullLib</code>. Since I deploy to a local SQL Server instance, I can use a file location for my <code>.jar</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The <a href="/2019/03/10/sql-server-2019-java--external-libraries---i/">Java &amp; External Libraries</a> post mentioned above goes into details about external libraries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The code to execute looks something like so:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">EXEC sp_execute_external_script
  @language = N'Java'
, @script = N'sql.NullValues'
, @input_data_1 = N'SELECT RowID, x, y FROM dbo.tb_NullRand10'
WITH RESULT SETS((RowID int, x int, y int))
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 4:</strong> <em>Execute Code</em></p>

<p>We see in <em>Code Snippet 4</em> how we call into the <code>NullValues</code> class in the <code>sql</code> package and how we use the same <code>SELECT</code> statement that generated the resultset we saw in <em>Figure 1</em>. When we execute the code, we see:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/sql-2k19-java-null2-result2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 2:</strong> <em>Java Code Result</em></p>

<p>Compare the result we see in <em>Figure 2</em> with the result in <em>Figure 1</em>, and we see the difference in the outlined rows, (3, 6, 8), and the highlighted columns, In <em>Figure 1</em> the columns are <code>NULL</code>, whereas in <em>Figure 2</em> they are <code>0</code>. So why are the columns <code>0</code>?</p>

<p>Well, as we said in the <a href="/2018/12/19/sql-server-2019-extensibility-framework--java---null-values/">null post</a>, this is because the Java language C++ extension converts the null values to the default value for the data type in question.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The Java language C++ extension is the bridge between SQL Server and your Java code. The <a href="/2019/06/06/sql-server-2019-extensibility-framework--external-languages/"><strong>SQL Server 2019 Extensibility Framework &amp; External Languages</strong></a> post covers it in some detail.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The question is, why do we care that a null value comes across as zero, at least we do not get a null exception? Let us take a look at the following Java code:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">public PrimitiveDataset execute(PrimitiveDataset input, 
                                LinkedHashMap&lt;String, Object&gt; params) {
    
  int[] inputCol3 = input.getIntColumn(2);

  int numRows = inputCol3.length;
  int sum = 0;

  for(int x = 0; x &lt; numRows; x++) {
    sum += inputCol3[x];

  }

  double avg = (double)sum / numRows;

  System.out.printf(&quot;Average value of y is: %f&quot;, avg);

  return null;
}

</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 5:</strong> <em>Average Value</em></p>

<p>The code in <em>Code Snippet 5</em> expects the same input data as we generated in <em>Code Snippet 4</em>, and it calculates the average value of the <code>y</code> column of that dataset. When we execute the code in <em>Code Snippet 4</em>, after having compiled, packaged and deployed, (comment out <code>WITH RESULT SETS</code>), we see the result as so:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/sql-2k19-java-null2-average.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 3:</strong> <em>Result of Average Calculation</em></p>

<p>The result in <em>Figure 3</em> looks OK, so let us see what it looks like if we run a similar query in SQL Server:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT CAST(AVG(CAST(y AS DECIMAL(4,2)))AS DECIMAL(4,2))
FROM dbo.tb_NullRand10;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 6:</strong> <em>T-SQL Average Calculation</em></p>

<p>The result of the query in <em>Code Snippet 6</em> looks like so:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/sql-2k19-java-null2-average2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 4:</strong> <em>Result of T-SQL Average Calculation</em></p>

<p>We see in <em>Figure 4</em> how the result of the average calculation, (outlined in red), differs from the Java calculation. The question is why this is; it was the same data in both calculations? Well, was it; we see in <em>Figure 4</em> the highlighted part at the top: &ldquo;Null value is eliminated &hellip;&rdquo;. So what happens is that for certain operations SQL Server eliminates null values, as SQL Server treats nulls as unknown.</p>

<p>As the Java language C++ extension converts nulls, we need to handle it in our Java code.</p>

<h4 id="input-nulls">Input Nulls</h4>

<p>In the previous <a href="/2018/12/19/sql-server-2019-extensibility-framework--java---null-values/">null post</a> we saw that, when we want to handle null input, we use a required class level variable <code>inputNullMap</code>, which the Java language extension populates &ldquo;automagically&rdquo;. However, after the introduction of the Java language SDK, this variable is not required any more. Even if you declared it, the Java language extension does not populate it.</p>

<p>So how do we then figure out whether a column has a null value? Well, since the Java language extension passes data into the <code>execute</code> method via the <code>PrimitiveDataSet</code> class, let us have a look at the base class for <code>PrimitiveDataSet</code>: <code>AbstractSqlServerExtensionDataset</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">public class AbstractSqlServerExtensionDataset {
  /**
   * Column metadata interfaces
   */
  public void addColumnMetadata(int columnId, String columnName, int columnType, 
                                int precision, int scale) {
    throw new UnsupportedOperationException(&quot;addColumnMetadata is not implemented&quot;);
  }

  ...

  public boolean[] getColumnNullMap(int columnId) {
    throw new UnsupportedOperationException(&quot;getColumnNullMap is not implemented&quot;);
  }

  ...
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 7:</strong> <em>AbstractSqlServerExtensionDataset</em></p>

<p>We see in <em>Code Snippet 7</em> how the <code>AbstractSqlServerExtensionDataset</code> has a section for metadata, and in that section is a method: <code>getColumnNullMap</code>. The method takes an integer as an input parameter, and it returns an array of type <code>boolean</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The Java SDK is open source, and you find it <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-language-extensions">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is what happens when the Java language C++ extension populates the dataset which is used as an input parameter:</p>

<ul>
<li>The extension creates a <code>boolean</code> array for each non-nullable Java datatype columns.</li>
<li>The extension loops each row for each column in the dataset.</li>
<li>Where there is a null value, for a primitive data type, the extension assigns the default value of the data type to that column.</li>
<li>When the extension comes across a null value in a non-nullable Java data type column, it sets the boolean array value to <code>true</code> in the column array.</li>
</ul>

<p>With this in mind we can change the code in <em>Code Snippet 5</em> to handle null values, or rather handle values in the dataset that originates from a SQL Server null value:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">public PrimitiveDataset execute(PrimitiveDataset input, 
                                LinkedHashMap&lt;String, Object&gt; params) {
    
  int[] inputCol3 = input.getIntColumn(2);

  int numRows = inputCol3.length;
  boolean[] nullMap = input.getColumnNullMap(2);
  int nonNull= 0;
  int sum = 0;

  for(int x = 0; x &lt; numRows; x++) {
    if(!nullMap[x]) {
      nonNull ++;
      sum += inputCol3[x];
    }

  }

  double avg = (double)sum / nonNull;

  System.out.printf(&quot;Average value of y is: %f&quot;, avg);

  return null;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 8:</strong> <em>Null Handling</em></p>

<p>So, in <em>Code Snippet 8</em> we see how we:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get the column we want to create the average over.</li>
<li>Use <code>getColumnNullMap</code> to retrieve the null map for the column we use for the calculation.</li>
<li>In the <code>for</code> loop check whether the column value is null or not. If it is not null, we include the value and increase the row count.</li>
<li>Finally do the average calculation.</li>
</ul>

<p>The result when executing the code in <em>Code Snippet 4</em> against our new code looks like so:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/sql-2k19-java-null2-average3.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 5:</strong> <em>New Java Average Calculation</em></p>

<p>We see in <em>Figure 5</em> how our Java calculation now gives the same result as the T-SQL calculation. Awesome!</p>

<h4 id="output-nulls">Output Nulls</h4>

<p>We have now seen how to use <code>getColumnNullMap</code> to distinguish input values that come in as <code>NULL</code> from SQL Server, which the Java language C++ extension converts to the default value for the Java data type.</p>

<p>What about if we need to return null values to SQL Server in a return dataset, but the Java data type is non-nullable? I.e. we receive data in the input dataset, and some column values for a non-nullable Java type are null when passed in from SQL Server. If we wanted to, for example, add the column to another column, the sum should be <code>NULL</code> if we were to handle it the same way as SQL Server does.</p>

<p>So how do we indicate to SQL Server that a column value is null, even though it has a value in Java? Let us go back to <em>Code Snippet 2</em> where we discussed how to return data to SQL Server from Java code. After &ldquo;newing&rdquo; up an instance of <code>PrimitiveDataset</code>, we defined the metadata for the columns via the <code>addColumnMetadata</code> method. We then added the row arrays for the columns through the <code>add*Type*Column</code>, (in our case it was <code>addIntColumn</code>), and it is in that method the &ldquo;secret&rdquo; to null values lies. Let us go back to <code>AbstractSqlServerExtensionDataset</code> and look at the signature for <code>addIntColumn</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">public class AbstractSqlServerExtensionDataset {
  
  /**
   * Adding column interfaces
   */
  public void addIntColumn(int columnId, int[] rows, 
                           boolean[] nullMap) {
    throw new UnsupportedOperationException(...);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 9:</strong> <em>Add Column Method</em></p>

<p>Look in <em>Code Snippet 9</em> at the third parameter in the add method. See how it takes a <code>boolean</code> array, and how the name &ldquo;gives it away&rdquo;: <code>nullMap</code>. If we look at other methods for non-nullable Java types, we see that all of them have this parameter, whereas add methods for types that are nullable do not have it.</p>

<p>So for non-nullable types, we define <code>boolean</code> arrays, and in those arrays, we indicate what row value(s) is <code>null</code>. Let us see an example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">public PrimitiveDataset execute(PrimitiveDataset input, 
                                LinkedHashMap&lt;String, Object&gt; params) {
    
  PrimitiveDataset output = new PrimitiveDataset();

  int numRows = 5;

  output.addColumnMetadata(0, &quot;RowID&quot;, Types.INTEGER, 0, 0);
  output.addColumnMetadata(1, &quot;IntCol&quot;, Types.INTEGER, 0, 0);
  output.addColumnMetadata(2, &quot;StringCol&quot;, Types.NVARCHAR, 256, 0);

  int[] rowIdRows = new int[numRows];
  int[] intColRows = new int[numRows];
  String[] stringColRows = new String[numRows];

  boolean[] intColNullMap = new boolean[numRows];

  for(int x = 0; x &lt; numRows; x++){
    rowIdRows[x] = x+1;
    if(x % 2 ==0) {
      intColRows[x] = 0;
      intColNullMap[x] = true;
    }
    else {
      intColRows[x] = x + 2;
      intColNullMap[x] = false;
    }
    if(x % 3 ==0) {
      stringColRows[x] = null;
    }
    else {
      stringColRows[x] = &quot;Hello number: &quot; + (x + 1);
    }
  }

  output.addIntColumn(0, rowIdRows, null);
  output.addIntColumn(1, intColRows, intColNullMap);
  output.addStringColumn(2, stringColRows);
 
  return output;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 10:</strong> <em>Return Dataset</em></p>

<p>What we see in <em>Code Snippet 10</em> is a somewhat contrived example where we return a dataset in which we want certain column values to be <code>NULL</code> in SQL Server. We see how we:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create metadata for the dataset.</li>
<li>Create arrays for the individual rows.</li>
<li>Create a null map for one of the integer columns.</li>
<li>In the <code>for</code> loop add values to the arrays, and based on some modulus operations emulate that some values are null.</li>
<li>Add the arrays to the columns, and for the second integer column, we also add the null map.</li>
<li>Finally return the dataset.</li>
</ul>

<p>A couple of things to notice in the code in <em>Code Snippet 10</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>A null-map is not required for a non-nullable data type columns if the values are not null.</li>
<li>We do not need a null-map for nullable data type columns.</li>
</ul>

<p>To see that our code works we use following code:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">EXEC sp_execute_external_script
  @language = N'Java'
, @script = N'sql.NullValues'
WITH RESULT SETS((RowID int, IntCol int, StringCol nvarchar(256)))
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 11:</strong> <em>Execute T-SQL</em></p>

<p>The result we get when executing the code in <em>Code Snippet 11</em>, looks like so:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/sql-2k19-java-null2-return-null.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 6:</strong> <em>Return Dataset with Null Values</em></p>

<p>When we look at <em>Figure 6</em> we see that our code worked, and how the Java C++ language extension converted the <code>0</code> values in the integer column to <code>NULL</code> based on the null map.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>In this post, we discussed how to handle null values in datasets passed into our Java code from SQL Server, and from our Java code back to SQL Server. I wrote about null handling in a previous <a href="/2018/12/19/sql-server-2019-extensibility-framework--java---null-values/">post</a>, but since that post, Microsoft introduced the Java language SDK for SQL Server, and null handling has changed.</p>

<p>We care about null values because, in SQL Server, all data types are nullable, whereas, in Java, that is not the case. In Java, like in .NET, primitive types, (<code>int</code>, etc.), cannot be null. The Java C++ language extension handles the mismatch between nullable in SQL Server and non-nullable in Java, whereby it converts null values in data from SQL Server to the data type&rsquo;s default value for Java. Going the other way, from Java to SQL Server, the C++ language extension converts the values supposed to be null to actual null values.</p>

<p>The way we handle null values after the introduction of the Java language SDK is that we:</p>

<ul>
<li>For input data, and each non-nullable column, we call <code>getColumnNullMap</code> and pass in the columns ordinal position. We then handle the values where the null map indicates a null value.</li>
<li>For output data we create <code>boolean</code> arrays for the columns which should contain null values in SQL Server. We pass the array in as a parameter to the <code>add*TypeName*Column</code> method.</li>
</ul>

I am now working on a follow-up post where I look at how to handle null values post the Java Extensibility SDK. Expect it to be published in a week or so.</p>

<p>This blog-post is the &ldquo;roundup&rdquo; of the things that have been most interesting to me, for the week just ending.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This week I do not have that much to share, partly because I have been occupied with writing a blog post about deploying <strong>SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster</strong> using <strong>Azure Data Studio</strong> (see below). It has also been <strong>SQL Saturday</strong> which I have been &ldquo;prepping&rdquo; for.</p>

<h2 id="data-science-machine-learning">Data Science / Machine Learning</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/09/09/ms-approx-query/">Experiences with approximating queries in Microsoft&rsquo;s production big-data clusters</a>. This is a dissection, by <a href="https://twitter.com/adriancolyer">Adrian</a>, of a white paper about approximating queries at Microsoft. Approximation of queries is used when you want to run analysis / OLAP queries against massive datasets where a query could potentially run for hours. By using approximation the time to run the query is reduced significantly.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/event-streaming-reflections-as-confluent-turns-five-part-1">Reflections on Event Streaming as Confluent Turns Five – Part 1</a>. This is a blog post by <a href="https://twitter.com/tlberglund">Tim Berglund</a>, (awesome name by the way), where he looks back at how Apache Kafka and the Confluent Platform has changed the way we build event-driven systems. Happy 5th Birthday to Confluent!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sql-server-2019-big-data-cluster">SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="/2019/09/11/install-sql-server-2019-big-data-cluster-using-azure-data-studio/">Install SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster using Azure Data Studio</a>. I had to tear down the <strong>SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/adriancolyer">Andrew</a> and me used for our workshop <strong>A Day of SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster</strong> in Johannesburg and rebuild it for the Cape Town leg of SQL Saturday. While I did the rebuild, I thought it would be a good idea to document what I did, and this blog post is the result.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sql-saturday">SQL Saturday</h2>

<p>The South African leg of SQL Saturday is done and dusted. We were in Cape Town yesterday, (Saturday, September 14), and I delivered two conference talks, (in addition to Andrew&rsquo;s and mine workshop mentioned above):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/download/s2k19-bdc-overview.pdf">A Lap Around SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster</a>: The new release of SQL Server; SQL Server 2019 includes Apache Spark and Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for scalable compute and storage. This new architecture that combines together the SQL Server database engine, Spark, and HDFS into a unified data platform is called a “big data cluster.”
This session gives you an overview of what a SQL Server Big Data Cluster is, and what you can do with it.</li>
<li><a href="/download/pirate-snake-coffee.pdf">What is the PiRate, Snake, and Cup of Coffee Doing in My Database?</a>: In this session we looked at the SQL Server Extensibility Framework, and we saw how we can call out to external languages from inside SQL Server. We looked at R, Python and Java, and what we can do from SQL Server having access to those languages.</li>

Back then <strong>SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster</strong> was in private preview, (CTP 2.1 I believe), and you had to sign up, to get access to the &ldquo;bits&rdquo;. Well, you did not really get any &ldquo;bits&rdquo;; what you did get was access to Python deployment scripts.</p>

<p>Now, September 2019, the BDC is in public preview (you do not have to sign up), and it has reached Release Candidate (RC) status, RC 1. The install method has changed, or rather, in addition to installing via deployment scripts, you can now also install using <strong>Azure Data Studio</strong> deployment notebooks, and that is what this blog post is about.</p>

<p>I install it on Azure, and since I am in South Africa, I use one of the South African hosting locations.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="pre-reqs">Pre-Reqs</h2>

<p>To deploy using <strong>Azure Data Studio</strong>, (ADS), you need ADS (duh - see below), but you also need some other things.</p>

<h4 id="azure-subscription">Azure Subscription</h4>

<p>If you want to install on <strong>Azure Kubernetes Service</strong>, (AKS), you need an Azure subscription. If you do not have one you can sign up for a free trial subscription <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Of course you do not need to install it on AKS, you can install it on basically any Kubernetes cluster</p>

<h4 id="python">Python</h4>

<p>Well, Python is not a tool as such, but you need Python installed on the machine you install from, as the ADS deployment runs some Python scrips. You need Python3, and on my machine, I have Python 3.7.3. Ensure that Python is on the <code>PATH</code>.</p>

<h4 id="azdata">azdata</h4>

<p><code>azdata</code> is a Python command-line tool replacing <code>mssqlctl</code>. It enables cluster administrators to bootstrap and manages the big data cluster via REST APIs.</p>

<p>There are a couple of steps to install it:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you have <code>mssqlctl</code> installed you need to uninstall it:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ pip3 uninstall -r https://private-repo.microsoft.com/ \
                           python/ctp3.1/mssqlctl/requirements.txt
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 1:</strong> <em>Uninstall <code>mssqlctl</code></em></p>

<p>In <em>Code Snippet 1</em> above I have inserted a line continuation (<code>\</code>) to make the code fit the page.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you have deployed CTP 3.2 of the BDC, then you need to uninstall that version of <code>azdata</code>:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-bash">pip3 uninstall -r https://azdatacli.blob.core.windows.net/ \
                  python/azdata/2019-ctp3.2/requirements.txt
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 2:</strong> <em>Uninstall <code>azdata</code></em></p>

<p>In <em>Code Snippet 2</em> you see how the uninstall command takes the version of <code>azdata</code> to uninstall: <em><code>2019-ctp3.2</code></em>. If you have the 3.2 version installed you need to confirm when you run the code in <em>Code Snippet 2</em> that you want to remove some installed components:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/inst-bdcrc1-uninst-azdata.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> <em>Confirm Uninstall <code>azdata</code></em></p>

<p>Just click <code>y</code> when asked to proceed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The biggest issue causing errors in a BDC deployment, by far, is using an older version of <code>azdata</code>. So please, do not be &ldquo;that guy&rdquo; (or girl) - make sure you uninstall <code>azdata</code> if you have an earlier version. In fact, before a deployment, always uninstall <code>azdata</code> followed by an install, (see below).</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>You need the latest version of the Python <code>requests</code> package installed:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ pip3 install -U requests
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 3:</strong> <em>Install/Upgrade <code>requests</code></em></p>

<ul>
<li>When you have executed the code in <em>Code Snippet 3</em> you can install <code>azdata</code>:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ pip3 install -r https://aka.ms/azdata
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 4:</strong> <em>Installing <code>azdata</code></em></p>

<p>After executing the code in <em>Code Snippet 4</em> you can go ahead and install the other tools needed.</p>

<h4 id="kubectl">kubectl</h4>

<p>The <code>kubectl</code> tool is a Kubernetes command-line tool, and it allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters. You can use <code>kubectl</code> to deploy applications, inspect and manage cluster resources, and view logs.</p>

<p>You can install <code>kubectl</code> in different ways, and I installed it from <a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages/kubernetes-cli">Chocolatey</a>: <code>choco install kubernetes-cli</code>.</p>

<h4 id="azure-cli">Azure CLI</h4>

<p>The Azure CLI is Microsoft&rsquo;s cross-platform command-line experience for managing Azure resources, and you install it on your local machine. You find install links for Azure CLI <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="azure-data-studio">Azure Data Studio</h2>

<p>Since this post is about installing and deploying a BDC using <strong>Azure Data Studio</strong>, you also need ADS. You may already have ADS installed, but to be able to install and deploy to the release candidate of BDC you need a specific install. If you have already installed ADS, this ADS version installs side-by-side with existing ADS installations.</p>

<p>The install link to the ADS RC version is <a href="https://aka.ms/azuredatastudio-rc">here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="sql-server-2019-preview">SQL Server 2019 (Preview)</h4>

<p>In addition to ADS, you also need the <strong>SQL Server 2019 (Preview)</strong> extension, which you install after installing ADS.</p>

<p>As opposed to other ADS extensions, you need to download the extension to your machine before you can install it. You download it from <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/sql-server-2019-extension">here</a>. After download, you install it from the <strong>File</strong> menu, and the <strong>Install Extension from VSIX Package</strong> item:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/inst-bdcrc1-inst-extension.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 2:</strong> <em>Install Extension</em></p>

<p>In <em>Figure 2</em> you see the <strong>File</strong> menu (outlined in blue), and the <strong>Install Extension from VSIX Package</strong> item outlined in red.</p>

<h4 id="azure-data-studio-notebooks">Azure Data Studio Notebooks</h4>

<p>I mentioned above that you deploy the BDC using ADS deployment <em>Notebooks</em>. You may ask yourself what an <strong>Azure Data Studio Notebook</strong> is? Well, Notebooks come from the Data Science world where a Notebook can contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. It is a tool for teaching or sharing information between people. A notebook makes it easy to link lots of docs and code together.</p>

<p>When Microsoft developed ADS, the embedded the <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> service in ADS, which enables ADS to run Notebooks. When you talk about Notebooks, you also talk about <em>Kernels</em>. A <em>Kernel</em> is the programming language you can write and execute code in, in the <em>Notebook</em>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/inst-bdcrc1-ads-notebook-kernels.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 3:</strong> <em>Notebook Kernels</em></p>

<p>The drop-down you see in <em>Figure 3</em> shows the <em>Kernels</em> ADS supports. When you deploy, you use the <em>Python 3</em> kernel.</p>

<p>If you have not used Python Notebooks before in ADS, you need to configure Python for use with Notebooks. You enter <strong>Ctrl+Shift+P</strong> to open the command palette, and you search for <em>Configure Python</em>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/inst-bdcrc1-ads-configure-notebooks.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 4:</strong> <em>Configure Notebooks</em></p>

<p>In <em>Figure 4</em> you see the command palette, and you choose <em>Configure Python for Notebooks</em>, and follow the instructions.</p>

<p>When you have configured Python for the notebooks, you are ready to deploy the BDC.</p>

<h2 id="deployment-settings">Deployment Settings</h2>

<p>The first step in the deployment is to configure settings which the notebook use.</p>

<p>After you launch ADS, you click on the <strong>Connections</strong> icon in the top of the <em>Activity</em> bar (leftmost panel in ADS). That opens the sidebar where you can see your connections. Click on the ellipsis, (the three dots &ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;), to the right in the top panel of the sidebar:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/inst-bdcrc1-ads-deploy.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 5:</strong> <em>Connections</em></p>

<p>You see in <em>Figure 5</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Connections icon outlined in yellow.</li>
<li>The three dots in the connections panel outlined in blue.</li>
<li>The pop-up menu items when clicking on the three dots.</li>
</ul>

<p>You also see in <em>Figure 5</em> that the pop-up menu gives you choices for SQL Server deployments. To deploy a BDC, you click on the item outlined in red:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/inst-bdcrc1-ads-deploy-options1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 6:</strong> <em>Connections</em></p>

<p>When you click on the *Deploy SQL Server big data cluster you see something like in <em>Figure 6</em>: the <em>Select the deployment options</em> dialog. You see in the dialog what you can deploy, and what options you have.</p>

<p>You choose <em>SQL Server big data cluster</em>, (outlined in blue), the version <em>SQL Server 2019 RC big data cluster</em>, (outlined in yellow), and the target to deploy to: <em>New Azure Kubernetes Service cluster</em>. When you click <strong>Select</strong> in the dialog, you see a new dialog:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/inst-bdcrc1-ads-new-cluster.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 7:</strong> <em>New AKS Cluster</em></p>

<p>You see in Figure 7* a settings dialog for the creation and deployment of your new cluster. All of the settings are relatively self-explanatory. However, there are two where you may not know how to retrieve them:</p>

<ul>
<li>Subscription id - you can have multiple subscriptions in Azure. This defines under which subscription to create the cluster. If you only have one subscription you leave this as is. If you have more subscriptions see below.</li>
<li>Region - in what Azure region your cluster should be created.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="subscription-id">Subscription id</h4>

<p>You retrieve subscription information either by using the Azure portal or logging in via the Azure CLI. I prefer to log-in using Azure CLI:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ az login
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 4:</strong> <em>Login to Azure</em></p>

<p>When I execute the code in <em>Code Snippet 4</em> a tab opens in my browser, and I see a dialog that asks me to pick an account to log in to Azure with:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/sql_2k19_bdc_az_login.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 8:</strong> <em>Azure Login</em></p>

<p>I choose the account from what I see in <em>Figure 8</em>, and after a little while, I see in the browser a success message:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/sql_2k19_bdc_az_login_success.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 9:</strong> <em>Azure Login Success</em></p>

<p>At the same time as the success message in <em>Figure 9</em>, the code in <em>Code Snippet 4</em> returns with information what subscriptions I have access to in Azure:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/sql_2k19_bdc_az_login_return.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 10:</strong> <em>Azure Login Return</em></p>

<p>As we see in <em>Figure 10</em>, I have access to multiple subscriptions, and I enter the id for the subscription I want to use in the <em>Subscription id</em> field.</p>

<h4 id="regions">Regions</h4>

<p>To see a list of Azure regions you execute <code>az account list-locations</code>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/inst-bdcrc1-azure-regions.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 11:</strong> <em>Azure Regions</em></p>

<p>When you execute the code above you get back a list of all regions you have access to and what you enter in the <em>Region</em> is the <code>name</code> property of your chosen region. In my case, I choose <code>southafricnorth</code>. When you have the necessary information, you set the various settings. For me the settings dialog looks like so:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/inst-bdcrc1-cluster-settings.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 12:</strong> <em>Azure Regions</em></p>

<p>It is worth noting that I have changed the <em>VM size</em>, and <em>VM count</em> from its default of <code>Standard_E4s_v3</code>, and <code>5</code> to <code>Standard_B8ms</code> and <code>3</code>. Reason for this is that having fewer nodes cuts down on install time. The thing to bear in mind here is that a BDC deployment requires at a minimum around 24 hard disks altogether in your cluster, and each VM has a set number of disks. In my case, each <code>Standard_B8ms</code> VM has 16 disks so I should be good (3 * 16).</p>

<h2 id="deployment-notebook">Deployment Notebook</h2>

<p>With the settings set you now click <strong>Open Notebook</strong>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/inst-bdcrc1-deploy-notbook1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 13:</strong> <em>Deploy Notebook</em></p>

<p>In <em>Figure 13</em> you see the opened deployment notebook. When you scroll through the notebook, you see the various stages of the deployment, and what it does in each stage:</p>

<ul>
<li>Check dependencies.</li>
<li>Required information.</li>
<li>Azure settings.</li>
<li>Default settings.</li>
<li>Login to Azure.</li>
<li>Set active Azure subscription.</li>
<li>Create Azure resource group.</li>
<li>Create AKS cluster.</li>
<li>Set the new AKS cluster as current context.</li>
<li>Create a deployment configuration file.</li>
<li>Create SQL Server 2019 big data cluster.</li>
<li>Login to SQL Server 2019 big data cluster.</li>
<li>Show SQL Server 2019 big data cluster endpoints.</li>
<li>Connect to master SQL Server instance in Azure Data Studio.</li>
</ul>

<p>To do the deployment, you can now either run each cell independently by clicking on the cell and hit F5 or click on the <strong>Run Cells</strong> command at the top of the notebook. In either case, you see what command the cell executes as well as the result:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/inst-bdcrc1-cell-output.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 14:</strong> <em>Cell Output</em></p>

<p>What you see in <em>Figure 14</em> is the output from creating the Azure resource group.</p>

<p>Be aware that the deployment takes a while, and especially the stage <em>Create SQL Server 2019 big data cluster</em>. Eventually, the deployment finishes, and you get an output from the cell <em>Show SQL Server 2019 big data cluster endpoints</em>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/inst-bdcrc1-endpoints.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 15:</strong> <em>Cell Output</em></p>

<p>The BDC exposes external endpoints for various services, and those are the ones you see in <em>Figure 15</em>. It is beyond the scope of this post to discuss what all those endpoints are, but the one outlined in red is the endpoint for the SQL Server master instance.</p>

<p>To connect to the master instance, you create a new connection:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/inst-bdcrc1-ads-connect.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 16:</strong> <em>New Connection</em></p>

<p>When you click the <em>New Connection</em> icon in the <em>Servers</em> panel in the sidebar that you see in <em>Figure 16</em>, a <em>Connection</em> dialog &ldquo;pops up&rdquo;:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/inst-bdcrc1-ads-new-connection.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 17:</strong> <em>Connection Dialog</em></p>

<p>In the <em>Connection</em> dialog you enter the details for your connection, including the IP address for the SQL Server master instance, and then you click <strong>Connect</strong>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/inst-bdcrc1-ads-connection.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 18:</strong> <em>Connected</em></p>

<p>As you see in <em>Figure 18</em>, you are now connected.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>In this post you saw how you can deploy a *<em>SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster</em> using <strong>Azure Data Studio</strong> and notebooks.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/microservices-ddd-bounded-contexts">PracticalDDD: Bounded Contexts + Events =&gt; Microservices</a>. An <a href="https://www.infoq.com/">InfoQ</a> presentation discussing the intersection of DDD as a software discipline with Messaging as a technology counterpart. DDD allows us to move faster and write high-quality code. When we start to use the technology of messaging to communicate between clean and well-defined bounded contexts, we get to remove temporal coupling. We now have microservices that are built for autonomy from the ground up. A fascinating presentation!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/uber-microservices-distributed-tracing">Conquering Microservices Complexity @Uber with Distributed Tracing</a>. Another <a href="https://www.infoq.com/">InfoQ</a> presentation. The presenter presents a methodology that uses data mining to learn the typical behavior of the system from massive amounts of distributed traces, compares it with pathological behavior during outages, and uses complexity reduction and intuitive visualizations to guide the user towards actionable insights about the root cause of the outages. This is a very, very interesting presentation!</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/09/04/slog/">SLOG: serializable, low-latency, geo-replicated transactions</a>. In this white paper, dissection, <a href="https://twitter.com/adriancolyer">Adrial</a> looks at SLOG. SLOG is a system which leverages physical region locality in an application workload to achieve: strict serializability, low-latency writes, and high transactional throughput, while also supporting online consistent dynamic &ldquo;re-mastering&rdquo; of data as application patterns change over time.</li>

<h1 id="sql-saturday">SQL Saturday</h1>

<p>I have just come back from SQL Saturday in Johannesburg where I delivered a workshop about SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster with a colleague of mine; <a href="https://twitter.com/datawookie">Andrew Collier</a>. I also delivered two presentations:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What is the PiRate, Snake, and Cup of Coffee Doing in My Database?</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>A Lap Around SQL Server Big Data Cluster</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Next week I do the big data cluster workshop with <a href="https://twitter.com/datawookie">Andrew</a>, <a href="https://www.quicket.co.za/events/80996-sqlsaturday-cape-town-2019-precon-with-neils-berglund-mvp-and-andrew-collier-sq/#/"><strong>A Day of SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster</strong></a>, on Friday (Sep., 13), and two presentations on Saturday (Sep., 14). I believe the presentation will be the same as in Johannesburg:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What is the PiRate, Snake, and Cup of Coffee Doing in My Database?</strong>. A talk about the SQL Server Extensibility Framework and how you can use R, Python and Java from inside SQL Server.</li>
<li><strong>A Lap Around SQL Server Big Data Cluster</strong>. This session gives you an overview of what a SQL Server Big Data Cluster is, and what you can do with it. We look at the various components, (Kubernetes, Spark, HDFS, PolyBase, etc.), and what you can do with them.</li>

<h1 id="sql-saturday">SQL Saturday</h1>

<p>It is early September, and that means that SQL Saturday is just around the corner. In fact, the Johannesburg leg of SQL Saturday is next weekend. I am fortunate enough to present in both Johannesburg and Cape Town.</p>

<p>Me together with a colleague - [Andrew Collier][acoll] - delivers a one day workshop: <strong>A Day of SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster</strong>, where we drill into - you guessed it - SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster. We do that Friday, September 6 in Johannesburg, and Friday, September 13 in Cape Town.</p>

<p>If you are interested to understand what SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster is all about, please register for Johannesburg <a href="https://www.quicket.co.za/events/81482-a-day-of-sql-server-2019-big-data-cluster-with-neils-berglund-and-andrew-collier#/">here</a>, or Cape Town <a href="https://www.quicket.co.za/events/80996-sqlsaturday-cape-town-2019-precon-with-neils-berglund-mvp-and-andrew-collier-sq/#/">here</a>.

<p>In Johannesburg, I deliver on Saturday, (September 7), two talks:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.sqlsaturday.com/903/Sessions/Details.aspx?sid=95909">What is the PiRate, Snake, and Cup of Coffee Doing in My Database?</a>. A talk about the SQL Server Extensibility Framework and how you can use R, Python and Java from inside SQL Server.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.sqlsaturday.com/903/Sessions/Details.aspx?sid=95908">A Lap Around SQL Server Big Data Cluster</a>. This session gives you an overview of what a SQL Server Big Data Cluster is, and what you can do with it. We look at the various components, (Kubernetes, Spark, HDFS, PolyBase, etc.), and what you can do with them.</li>
</ul>

<p>In Cape Town, Saturday, September 14, I also deliver two talks:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.sqlsaturday.com/897/Sessions/Details.aspx?sid=95915">Set Your SQL Server Data Free with the Use of Kafka</a>. In this talk, we look at how we can stream data from SQL Server to the de facto standard for streaming: Apache Kafka. We look at tools like Kafka Connect and external languages, and after the session, we should have a good understanding of various ways we can &ldquo;set the data free&rdquo;.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.sqlsaturday.com/897/Sessions/Details.aspx?sid=95916">SQL Server Machine Learning Services &amp; External R/Python Packages</a>. SQL Server Machine Learning Services supports both R and Python, and they come with all the regular packages installed. However, there are a lot more packages available &ldquo;out in the wild&rdquo;. In this session, you learn various ways you can install both R and Python packages in SQL Server instances.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is late August, and I am in a state of panic! Why, well - the conference season is upon us, and I have months, and months ago, submitted some talks and workshops - and now it is time to get those talks and workshops ready. In other words, I am burning the midnight oil.</p>

<p>Me together with a colleague - <a href="https://twiter.com/datawookie">Andrew Collier</a> - delivers a one day workshop: <strong>A Day of SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster</strong>, where we drill into - you guessed it - SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster. We do that Friday, September 6 in Johannesburg, and Friday, September 13 in Cape Town.</p>

<p>If you are interested to understand what SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster is all about, please register for Johannesburg <a href="https://www.quicket.co.za/events/81482-a-day-of-sql-server-2019-big-data-cluster-with-neils-berglund-and-andrew-collier#/">here</a>, or Cape Town <a href="https://www.quicket.co.za/events/80996-sqlsaturday-cape-town-2019-precon-with-neils-berglund-mvp-and-andrew-collier-sq/#/">here</a>.

    <link href="https://nielsberglund.com/2019/08/03/sql-server-2019-ctp3.2--java/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/>
    <updated>2019-08-03T06:55:33+02:00</updated>
    <id>https://nielsberglund.com/2019/08/03/sql-server-2019-ctp3.2--java/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It seems that for each new SQL Server 2019 CTP release, there are changes to the Java extensions, and CTP 3.2 is no exception. Well, that is not exactly true as in CTP 3.2 release the changes are not about the extension and how we write code, but Java itself.</p>

<p>One of the <a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2019/07/24/free-supported-java-in-sql-server-2019-is-now-available/">announcements</a> of what is new in CTP 3.2 was that SQL Server now includes <a href="https://www.azul.com/">Azul System&rsquo;s</a> Zulu Embedded right out of the box for all scenarios where we use Java in SQL Server, including Java extensibility.</p>

<p>So, in this post, we look at the impact, (if any), this has to how we use the Java extensibility framework in SQL Server 2019.</p>

<p></p>

<p>First of all, I find Microsoft&rsquo;s change of stance related to Java very interesting as I remember back in the day the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Java_Virtual_Machine">battle</a> between Sun and Microsoft regarding Java and the subsequent Java vs .NET &ldquo;war&rdquo;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Around <sup>1995</sup>&frasl;<sub>96</sub> I attended a Microsoft event in London where Microsoft introduced what was to be Visual J++. It went under the code name &ldquo;Jakarta&rdquo;. The MS people presenting at the conference explained why they chose that name: <em>Jakarta is the capital of Java</em>. That was not entirely true as Jakarta is the capital of Indonesia, but Java is the largest island, so&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyway, let us get on with it, and see what happens when we install SQL Server 2019 CTP 3.2.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>You may remember from <a href="/2018/12/02/sql-server-2019-extensibility-framework--java---hello-world/">SQL Server 2019 Extensibility Framework &amp; Java - Hello World</a> that to enable Java in SQL Server 2019; you have to - during installation - choose the <em>Machine Learning Services</em> feature:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/sql_2k19_java_intro_install1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> <em>Enable In-Database Machine Learning</em></p>

<p>In <em>Figure 1</em> we have chosen <em>Machine Learning Services</em> which ensures that the required components, (<em>Launchpad</em>, and so on), gets installed. In pre-CTP 3.2, we had to - in addition to choosing <em>Machine Learning Services</em> - also ensure that Java is installed on the box where we install the SQL Server instance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> We also need to do other &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; if we want to enable Java, and I cover that below.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When we install SQL Server CTP 3.2, we see something like so:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/s2k19_ctp32_java.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 2:</strong> <em>Java Feature Selection</em></p>

<p>What we see in <em>Figure 2</em> is:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <em>Machine Learning Services</em> feature is now named <em>Machine Learning Services and Language Extensions</em>.</li>
<li>Java appears as a feature in the same way as R/Python.</li>
</ul>

<p>We choose Java as a feature, as in <em>Figure 2</em>, and after feature rules and instance configuration, we come to a new dialog; <em>Java Install Location</em>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/s2k19_ctp32_java2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 3:</strong> <em>Java Install Location</em></p>

<p>In the dialog, we see in <em>Figure 3</em>, how we have the ability to choose to install the Azule Zulu OpenJDK which is part of the SQL Server install. We choose the OpenJDK and continue with the installation.</p>

<p>Eventually the installation finish, and if we look in the installation path of the instance we just installed, we see:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/s2k19_ctp32_openjdk.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 4:</strong> <em>Azule Zulu OpenJDK</em></p>

<p>If we drill down in the <code>AZUL-OpenJDK-JRE</code> directory, we see it is the directory for the Java JRE. So we now have Java installed, and theoretically, we should be able to execute Java code, exactly as we execute R/Python?</p>

<h2 id="post-install">Post Install</h2>

<p>Well, to execute Java code is not as straightforward as in the previous paragraph even though Java is now installed. We still have to do some things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enable external scripts: <code>EXEC sp_configure 'external scripts enabled', 1</code></li>
<li>Register Java as an external language in the database from where you want to execute your code: <code>CREATE EXTERNAL LANGUAGE ...</code>. Read more about it in <a href="/2019/06/06/sql-server-2019-extensibility-framework--external-languages/">SQL Server 2019 Extensibility Framework &amp; External Languages</a>.</li>
<li>Deploy the Java external language extension SDK to the database above: <code>CREATE EXTERNAL LIBRARY ...</code>. Refer to <a href="/2019/05/26/java--sql-server-2019-extensibility-framework-the-sequel/">Java &amp; SQL Server 2019 Extensibility Framework: The Sequel</a> for more about that.</li>
</ul>

<p>When the above is done, we deploy our code either via <code>CREATE EXTERNAL LIBRARY ...</code>, or have our code available in the <code>CLASSPATH</code>. Having done that we should be able to execute:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">DECLARE @p1 int = 21;
DECLARE @p2 int = 21;
EXEC sp_execute_external_script
  @language = N'Java'
, @script = N'sql.JavaTest1'
, @params = N'@x int, @y int'
, @x = @p1
, @y = @p2   
GO
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 1:</strong> <em>Execute Java Code</em></p>

<p>In <em>Code Snippet 1</em> we see that we want to <code>EXEC sp_execute_external_script</code> against some Java code deployed as a <code>.jar</code>, (this is the same code as in the <a href="/2019/06/06/sql-server-2019-extensibility-framework--external-languages/">external languages</a> post). However, when we execute the result is like so:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/s2k19_ctp32_exec1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 5:</strong> <em>Missing Environment Variable</em></p>

<p>So even though we explicitly said during the SQL installation that we want to use the included Java and it got installed, we still need to set the <code>JRE_HOME</code> variable. The installation does not do that for us.</p>

<p>After we have created the <code>JRE_HOME</code> environment variable and set it to point to the <code>AZUL-OpenJDK-JRE</code> directory we see in <em>Figure 4</em>, we need to restart the <em>Launchpad</em> service, and then we can execute the code in <em>Code Snippet 1</em> again:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/s2k19_ctp32_exec2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 6:</strong> <em>Success</em></p>

<p>Now everything works as we see in <em>Figure 6</em>.</p>

<h2 id="scenarios">Scenarios</h2>

<p>Even though we explicitly choose the included Java in the installation, we still need to set up Java as in pre-CTP 3.2, so what does this give us?</p>

<p>It gives us peace of mind! Remember that Oracle is phasing out free support for Java, and I wonder how interested they are in solving issues with Java on SQL Server. If we use open source OpenJDK, we rely on the community for support, which may not be ideal in an enterprise production environment. So by using the included Java, we are guaranteed enterprise support - peace of mind!</p>

<p>Does this then mean that we need to use the included Java? Not at all! Below follows some scenarios/options. All require what we did above; create external language, deploy the SDK, deploy your code:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enable <em>Machine Learning Services and Language Extensions</em> only, (no Java): Ensure that your <code>JRE_HOME</code> environment variable points to whatever Java JRE you want to use.</li>
<li>Enable <em>Machine Learning Services and Language Extensions</em> including Java, (as per above): The <code>JRE_HOME</code> variable can point to some other Java JRE than Azul, even though the Azul JDK gets installed.</li>
</ul>

<p>What happens if I enable Java, but instead of choosing the included JRE as in <em>Figure 3</em>, I choose the second option: I provide the location of a different JRE? For Java in <em>Machine Learning Services and Language Extensions</em> that has no effect. You need to, as in all other scenarios, point the <code>JRE_HOME</code> variable to a valid JRE directory.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> It is good practice to whenever you change, (or first set), the <code>JRE_HOME</code> variable to restart the <em>Launchpad</em> service.</p>
</blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth, that has to do with things that interest me:</p>

<ul>
<li>data science</li>
<li>data in general</li>
<li>distributed computing</li>
<li>SQL Server</li>
<li>transactions (both db as well as non db)</li>
<li>and other &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>This blog-post is the &ldquo;roundup&rdquo; of the things that have been most interesting to me, for the week just ending.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="distributed-computing">Distributed Computing</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2019/07/dissecting-performance-bottlenecks-of.html">Dissecting performance bottlenecks of strongly-consistent replication protocols</a>. This is a post by <a href="https://twitter.com/muratdemirbas">Murat</a> about one of his white papers. The post dissects the white paper which discusses the performance of Paxos protocols. If you are into distributed computing and consensus protocol, this is for you.</li>
<li><a href="https://goto.docker.com/virtual-event-docker-enterprise-3.0.html">Drive High-Velocity Innovation with Docker Enterprise 3.0</a>. Earlier this week <a href="https://blog.docker.com/2019/07/announcing-docker-enterprise-3-0-ga/">Docker announced general availability</a> of Docker Enterprise 3.0. The post I link to is registration for a 5-part virtual event to get a deep dive on new features and enhancements in Docker Enterprise 3.0.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/kafka-distributed-deployments">Streaming Log Analytics with Kafka</a>. This is an <a href="https://www.infoq.com/">InfoQ</a> presentation where the presenter discusses how and why they use Kafka internally and demos how they utilize it as a straightforward event-sourcing model for distributed deployments.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/fault-tolerance-distributed-systems-tracing-with-apache-kafka-jaeger">Fault Tolerance in Distributed Systems: Tracing with Apache Kafka and Jaeger</a>. This is the second post about distributed tracing with Kafka and Jaeger. This post looks at how to make Jaeger fault-tolerant, i.e. how to safeguard against Jaeger going down.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sql-server-2019">SQL Server 2019</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2019/07/24/sql-server-2019-community-technology-preview-3-2-is-now-available/">SQL Server 2019 community technology preview 3.2 is now available</a>. I guess the title of the post says it all; CTP 3.2 is released. One of the big &ldquo;things&rdquo; in this release is that the SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster (BDC) is now in public preview. What this means is that you no longer need to sign up for the preview, but you can deploy directly. Look out for an upcoming blog post from me regarding this.</li>
<li><a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2019/07/24/free-supported-java-in-sql-server-2019-is-now-available/">Free supported Java in SQL Server 2019 is now available</a>. Wow, &ldquo;the times they are a changin&rsquo;&rdquo;, as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7qQ6_RV4VQ">Bob Dylan sang</a>! I remember years and years ago, the battle between Microsoft and Sun regarding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Java_Virtual_Machine">Java</a>. Who would then have thought that come 2019, Microsoft would include Java in one of Microsoft&rsquo;s flagship products: SQL Server 2019. Very cool!</li>
</ul>
