        <p>As many of you know, I am an un-ashamed .NET developer on the Windows platform. Seeing that I do a lot of SQL Server development my development and OS platforms of choice is sufficient for my work, as I on my development box (Windows of course) install SQL Server Developer edition and whatever .NET framework I use.</p>

<p>That has been sufficient up until now when I want to develop against Kafka. At <a href="/derivco">Derivco</a> we are getting more and more interested in Kafka, and obviously, I want to install it so I can <del>play around</del> investigate it. However, to install it on my development machine as I would typically do with technologies I am interested in, SQL Server, RabbitMQ, etc., is difficult, if not impossible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Yes I know, there are articles on the web discussing how to run Kafka on Windows, but it is a hit and miss whether it works.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A while ago I wrote a <a href="/2018/07/10/install-confluent-platform-kafka-on-windows/">post</a> about how to run Kafka under <strong>Windows Subsystem for Linux</strong> (WSL), and yes it works, but I have had issues with it, and to me, it is still a hack. So the options then (if we rule out WSL) are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Running it on a Linux in a virtualized environment, (Virtual Box, VMWare, Hyper-V, etc.).</li>
<li>Docker.</li>
</ul>

<p>The rest of this post goes through how to set up the <em>Confluent Platform</em> in a Docker environment and use it from .NET.</p>

While I wrote that post, Microsoft released SQL Server 2019 CTP 3.0, and, (surprise, surprise), that release contains more changes affecting Java code in SQL Server.</p>

<p>This post covers those changes as well as discusses what SQL Server Extensibility Framework and Language Extensions are.</p>

        <p>As you may know, a while back I wrote some posts about the support for Java in SQL Server 2019: <a href="/s2k19_ext_framework_java"><strong>SQL Server 2019 Extensibility Framework &amp; Java</strong></a>. The posts covered in some detail how Java in SQL Server worked, and how to write Java code for use in SQL Server. However, a week or two ago &ldquo;the sky came tumbling down&rdquo; when Microsoft released SQL Server 2019 CTP 2.5.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> CTP stands for Community Technology Preview and is like a beta release.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What Microsoft did in CTP 2.5 was to introduce Java Language Extension SDK, and your Java code now needs to inherit an abstract base class from the SDK. This requirement makes a large part of my previous posts &ldquo;null and void&rdquo;, so in this post, we look at what to do going forward.</p>

        <p>This post is the fourth in a series about installing R packages in <strong>SQL Server Machine Learning Services</strong> (SQL Server ML Services). To see all posts in the series go to <a href="/sql_server_ml_services_install_packages"><strong>Install R Packages in SQL Server ML Services Series</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Why this series came about is a colleague of mine <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dane-bax/">Dane</a> pinged me and asked if I had any advice as he had issues installing an R package into one of their SQL Server instances. I tried to help him and then thought it would make a good topic for a blog post. Of course, at that time I didn&rsquo;t think it would be more posts than one, but here we are.</p>

<p>In this post, we look at:</p>

<ul>
<li>What permissions <code>CREATE EXTERNAL LIBRARY</code> requires.</li>
<li>The ability to create external libraries with different owners and what impact it has.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the previous post about external libraries, we said that they were beneficial as they reduced complexities when deploying code, but there were still some caveats. So, in this post, we look at how to overcome those caveats</p>

        <p>A couple of months ago I wrote a series of posts about one of the new features in SQL Server 2019; the ability to call out to Java code from inside SQL Server.</p>

<p>To see the posts, go to <a href="/s2k19_ext_framework_java"><strong>SQL Server 2019 Extensibility Framework &amp; Java</strong></a>.</p>

<p>In the posts, we discussed how the Java extension differs from R and Python in that R and Python are an integrated part of the SQL Server install (when enabling in-database analytics), but Java is not. In other words, the use of the Java extension requires Java to be installed beforehand, and this then has implications on permissions. We also discussed how Java is a compiled language, and we execute against a method in a class, whereas with R and Python we send a script to the external engine. The consequence of this is that when we execute Java code, we need to indicate where the compiled code resides, and those locations need specific permissions.</p>

<p>All this creates a level of complexity, and it would potentially be easier if we load the Java code from a well-known place, where we do not need to worry about permissions and so forth.</p>

<p>This post is the first of a couple where we see how new functionality in SQL Server 2019 CTP 2.3 can help.</p>

        <p>As you know, SQL Server 2019 introduces the Java language extensions as part of the <strong>SQL Server Extensibility Framework</strong>. The Java language extensions make it possible to execute Java code from inside SQL Server, the same way we can run R/Python code. Seeing that I am &ldquo;somewhat&rdquo; interested in the <strong>SQL Server Extensibility Framework</strong> I wrote some posts about the Java language extensions: <a href="/s2k19_ext_framework_java"><strong>SQL Server 2019 Extensibility Framework &amp; Java</strong></a>.</p>

<p>The code in the posts is very, very simplistic where I was just trying to get the ideas across how and what to do. Another reason the code is simplistic is that I am not a Java &ldquo;person&rdquo;; in fact, the only Java code I have ever written is what is in those posts. Me not being a Java &ldquo;person&rdquo; I do not have a Java IDE, (for the code I wrote I did not need one either), so I used my regular text editor <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text 3</a>, and I compiled the code from command line (<code>$ javac ...</code>).</p>

<p>I then started on a new Java post (which I have not finished yet), and it became clear I needed an IDE, (intelli-sense, debug, etc.), but which IDE?</p>

        <p>This post came about due to a question on the <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=MicrosoftR">Microsoft Machine Learning Server</a> forum. The <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/70e3577c-58f1-40af-9f0b-546c8b181cfa/sql-server-r-services-are-more-input-datasets-planned-or-under-development?forum=MicrosoftR">question</a> was if there are any plans by Microsoft to support more the one input dataset (<code>@input_data_1</code>) in <code>sp_execute_external_script</code>. My immediate reaction was that if you want more than one dataset, you can always connect from the script back into the database, and retrieve data.</p>

<p>However, the poster was well aware of that, but due to certain reasons he did not want to do it that way - he wanted to push in the data, fair enough. When I read this, I seemed to remember something from a while ago, where, instead of retrieving data from inside the script, they pushed in the data, serialized it as an output parameter and then used the binary representation as in input parameter (yeah - this sounds confusing, but bear with me). I did some research (read Googling), and found <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42918990/how-to-pass-two-sql-tables-as-input-parameter-for-r-codes-in-sql-server">this</a> StackOverflow question, and answer. So for future questions, and for me to remember, I decided to write a blog post about it.</p>

        <p>The SQL Server 2016 release introduced the <strong>SQL Server Extensibility Framework</strong> (EF), which gives us the ability to, from inside SQL Server, execute code in an external language runtime environment. SQL Server 2016 supports R as external runtime, and Microsoft added Python to supported runtimes in the SQL Server 2017 release. The important part about the EF is that the runtime is outside of the core database engine, but we call it from inside SQL Server via the stored procedure <code>sp_execute_external_script</code>. We can push data from SQL Server queries to the external runtime, and consume data, (resultsets, output parameters) from the external runtime back in SQL Server.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You can read more about the actual implementation of the external runtimes and <code>sp_execute_external_script</code> in my <a href="/sql_server_2k16_r_services">SQL Server R Services Series</a> posts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In SQL Server 2019 Microsoft added the ability to execute custom Java code along the same lines we execute R and Python, and this blog post intends to give an introduction of how to install and enable the Java extension, as well as execute some very basic Java code. In future posts, I drill down how to pass data back and forth between SQL Server and Java.</p>

        <p>At the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ignite/agenda"><strong>Microsoft Ignite 2018</strong></a> conference back in September Microsoft released <strong>SQL Server 2019</strong> for public preview, and I wrote two short blog posts about it:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/2018/09/24/what-is-new-in-sql-server-2019-public-preview/">What is New in SQL Server 2019 Public Preview</a>.</li>
<li><a href="/2018/09/29/sql-server-2019-for-linux-in-docker-on-windows/">SQL Server 2019 for Linux in Docker on Windows</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>What Microsoft also announced was <strong>SQL Server 2019 Big Data Clusters</strong>, which combines the SQL Server database engine, Spark, and HDFS into a unified data platform! Yes, you read that right: SQL Server, Spark, and Hadoop right out of the box. Seeing that both Spark and Hadoop are mainly Linux based, what makes the Big Data Cluster possible is <strong>SQL Server on Linux</strong>. When you deploy a <strong>SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster</strong>, you deploy it as containers on <strong>Kubernetes</strong>, where the Kubernetes cluster can be in the cloud, such as <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/"><strong>Azure Kubernetes Service</strong></a>, or on-prem like <a href="https://www.openshift.com/learn/topics/kubernetes/"><strong>Red Hat OpenShift</strong></a> or even on a local dev-box/laptop using <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube/"><strong>Minikube</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Initially, this post was about <strong>SQL Server 2019 Big Data Clusters</strong> on Minikube, but after quite a few failed installation attempts I realised I did not have enough memory on my development box, so I decided to try it on <strong>Azure Kubernetes Service</strong> (AKS) instead.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you want to run <strong>SQL Server 2019 Big Data Clusters</strong> on Minikube it is suggested that your host machine (Minikube is essentially a VM) has at least 32Gb of memory, and you allocate at least 22Gb to the Minikube VM.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since I am a complete novice when it comes to Kubernetes, this post covers both how I set up AKS as well as the deployment of <strong>SQL Server 2019 Big Data Clusters</strong> to AKS, and the post is somewhat a summary of the official <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/big-data-cluster/big-data-cluster-overview?view=sqlallproducts-allversions">documentation</a>.</p>

        <p>By the time I publish this blog post <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ignite">MS Ignite</a> is over. During Ignite, Microsoft announced quite a few new things, amongst them <strong>SQL Server 2019</strong> with a whole lot of new features and functionality.</p>

<p>I touched briefly on some of them in my <a href="/2018/09/24/what-is-new-in-sql-server-2019-public-preview/">What is New in SQL Server 2019 Public Preview</a> post. A couple of things that caught my eye were that <strong>SQL Server 2019 for Linux</strong> now supports In-Database analytics, what we know as <strong>SQL Server Machine Learning Services</strong> (R and Python), as well as the Java language extension.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You may ask yourself what the Java language extension is; well, that is the ability to access Java code from T-SQL. It is a little bit like SQLCLR, but it executes outside of the SQL Server memory and process space.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seeing that I never really have played around with <em>SQL Server for Linux</em>, mostly due to that in previous versions (2017) it did not have support for In-Database analytics, I thought that now would be a good time to have a look.</p>

        <p>If you read my roundup for <a href="/2018/09/23/interesting-stuff---week-38/">week 38</a>, which I published yesterday, you probably noticed that <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ignite"><strong>MS Ignite</strong></a> started today. I mentioned in the post that I was particularly interested in some of the <strong>SQL Server</strong> sessions, as they looked very interesting.</p>

<p>However, even before the sessions started, Microsoft released SQL Server 2019 CTP 2.0 for public preview and, naturally, I jumped on the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-sql-server-2019-ctp">download link</a> and started downloading. I managed to get to the link in time before the rest of the world started the download, so I managed to get it down and then did an install.</p>

<p>The rest of this post is about my initial findings mostly in the SQL Server Machine Learning Services space.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I have looked at SQL Server 2019 the grand total of an hour, so this is a short post.</p>
</blockquote>

        <p>In my <a href="/2018/08/18/goodbye-jekyll-welcome-hugo/">Goodbye Jekyll, Welcome Hugo!</a> post I wrote how I have changed blog engine from Jekyll to Hugo, and how everything seemed to work. Saying that obviously jinxed it, as after I deployed to the hosting site my Atom feed was completely hosed.</p>

<p>I have now spent 4 hours trying to fix everything, but I am not sure I have succeeded. So this is a test post to see if things look OK.</p>

        <p>Back in 2013 I wrote a <a href="/2013/10/02/moving-to-a-new-blog-engine/">post</a> about how I moved from a self hosted <strong>WordPress</strong> blog to a static blog; <a href="http://octopress.org"><strong>OctoPress</strong></a>. OctoPress spoke to my &ldquo;geeky&rdquo; side, as the foundation of it is the static blog-generator <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/"><strong>Jekyll</strong></a>, which in turn is Ruby based. In fact, OctoPress is more or less just some extra Ruby plugins on top of Jekyll, and to generate sites with OctoPress / Ruby you need Ruby installed on you machine.</p>

<p>I thought that by changing the blog platform, I might write more posts just due to the &ldquo;geekiness&rdquo; of the blog engine. Fast forward to the end of 2016, and the number of posts I had written since the switch came to a grand total of three. Those three includes the post where I announced the switch. Yeah, switching increased indeed my productivity - NOT!</p>

<p>So what does this have to do with anything?</p>

Afterwards I realised I had some things wrong, so I wrote a followup post: <a href="/2018/05/20/sp_execute_external_script-and-sql-compute-context---i/">sp_execute_external_script and SQL Compute Context - I</a> where I tried to correct my mistakes from the <a href="/2018/03/21/microsoft-sql-server-r-services---sp_execute_external_script---iii/">initial post</a>. That post led to <a href="/2018/07/07/sp_execute_external_script-and-sql-compute-context---ii/">sp_execute_external_script and SQL Compute Context - II</a> and now we have a mini-series.</p>

<p>To see other posts (including this) in the series, go to <a href="/spees_and_sql_compute_context"><strong>sp_execute_external_script and SQL Server Compute Context</strong></a>.</p>

<p>In the previous post in this series, we looked at how data is sent to the SqlSatellite from SQL Server when we are in the SQLCC. This post was meant to look at what goes on inside SQL Server when we execute in SQLCC, but I realised that it would make more sense if, before we look at the internal working when in SQLCC, I covered what happens when pulling data in the local context. So that is what this post is all about.</p>

        <p>You who follows my blog and have read my weekly roundups you know that I am quite (that is an understatement) interested in Apache Kafka and I am curious to find out what &ldquo;cool&rdquo; things one can do with it. For that, I want to be able to test &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; quickly. When I test and try out new things, I usually do it on my development box which contains everything I need: <strong>SQL Server</strong>, <strong>RabbitMQ</strong>, <strong>RStudio</strong>, <strong>Microsoft Machine Learning Server</strong>, <strong>Visual Studio</strong> and the list goes on.</p>

<p>So seeing that I have most of my &ldquo;tools of the trade&rdquo; on my machine I obviously also would like to have Kafka on the box. Herein lies a problem, I am a Windows dude and Kafka, and Windows do not gel. Yes, some people are running Kafka on Windows, but it is a chore. OK, so what to do? Sure, I could potentially run Kafka on a virtual machine, or in a Docker image, but it is not as transparent as I would like it to be (yeah, I am lazy).</p>

<p>Hmm, Microsoft did introduce the ability to run Linux binary executables (in ELF format) natively on Windows 10 in Windows 10 version 1607. The feature is called <strong>Windows Subsystem for Linux</strong> (WSL), and since I am now running version 1803, maybe I should try and install Kafka in <em>WSL</em>.</p>

        <p>I wrote the post <a href="/2018/05/20/sp_execute_external_script-and-sql-compute-context---i/">sp_execute_external_script and SQL Compute Context - I</a> about how the <strong>SQL Server Compute Context</strong> (SQLCC) works with <code>sp_execute_external_script</code> (SPEES), as I wanted to correct some mistakes I did in the <a href="/2018/03/21/microsoft-sql-server-r-services---sp_execute_external_script---iii/">Microsoft SQL Server R Services - sp_execute_external_script - III</a> post. I initially thought one post would be enough, but quite soon I realised I was too optimistic, and at least one more post would be needed, if not more. So this is the first followup post about SPEES and SQLCC.</p>

<p>To see other posts (including this) in the series, go to <a href="/spees_and_sql_compute_context"><strong>sp_execute_external_script and SQL Server Compute Context</strong></a>.</p>

<p>One of the reasons for me realising that one post is not enough is that while I wrote and executed code for the first <a href="/2018/05/20/sp_execute_external_script-and-sql-compute-context---i/">post</a>, I noticed some fairly significant performance differences using SQLCC compared to not using SQLCC (SQLCC performed better :)). So that is part of what we look at in this post.</p>

<p>To see all posts in the series go to <a href="/sql_server_ml_services_install_packages"><strong>Install R Packages in SQL Server ML Services Series</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Why this series came about is a colleague of mine <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dane-bax/">Dane</a> pinged me and asked if I had any advice as he had issues installing an R package into one of their SQL Server instances. I tried to help him and then thought it would make a good topic for a blog post. Of course, at that time I didn&rsquo;t think it would be more posts than one, but here we are.</p>

        <p>This post was supposed to be a single post about how to install R packages in SQL Server Machine Learning Services, but once again I completely misjudged the scope of the topic. So this one post turned into a series of posts about how to install R packages in <strong>SQL Server Machine Learning Services</strong> and this is the first post in the series.</p>

<p>To see other posts in the series go to <a href="/sql_server_ml_services_install_packages"><strong>Install R Packages in SQL Server ML Services Series</strong></a>.</p>

<p>As you may know, I am in the process of writing the follow-up post to <a href="/2018/05/20/sp_execute_external_script-and-sql-compute-context---i/">sp_execute_external_script and SQL Compute Context - I</a>. However, I have a hard time getting into the flow of things, so I use any excuse I can, to not have to write. So when <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dane-bax/">Dane Bax</a>, a colleague of mine, contacted me a couple of days ago with a <strong>SQL Server Machine Learning Services</strong> problem, I jumped at the chance to help him, and also write a post about it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dane-bax/">Dane</a> works for a sister company of <a href="/Derivco">Derivco</a> as a data scientist and at both <a href="/Derivco">Derivco</a> and the sister company - <a href="https://www.microgaming.co.uk/">Microgaming</a> we are now looking at using SQL Server Machine Learning Services.</p>

<p>His problem was that he wanted to use a CRAN package - <code>bsts</code> - which is not part of a standard SQL Server R installation. He tried a couple of things to get it installed but got errors, so he decided to get in touch with me.</p>

        <p>This post is as much for you as it is for me to come back to when I wonder what to do when SQL Serer Machine Learning Services all of a sudden stops working after a SQL Server upgrade.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Last week I did a complete reformat of my development box at home and installed the latest version of Windows 10: the 1803 build, also called the April 2018 update.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I usually try to reformat my box at least twice a year, to ensure it is not too &ldquo;bogged&rdquo; down by old &ldquo;cruft&rdquo;, and that it has the latest and greatest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After the reformat I installed all my necessary applications, among them SQL Server 2017 with the in-database analytics components (R and Python). After installation I tested that it all worked and made sure I could execute my usual test scripts for <code>sp_execute_external_script</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">EXEC sp_execute_external_script   @language = N'R'
                                , @script = N'd &lt;- 42'
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 1:</strong> <em>Test Script for R</em></p>

<p>The &ldquo;moral&rdquo; equivalent to <em>Code Snippet 1</em> in Python also worked without an issue:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">EXEC sp_execute_external_script   @language = N'Python'
                                , @script = N'd = 42'
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 2:</strong> <em>Test Script for Python</em></p>

<p>Cool, all is &ldquo;A-OK&rdquo;! A couple of days go by, and I see that there is a Cumulative Update (CU) for SQL Server 2017 - CU7. I install it and does not think much about it. I mean: &ldquo;what can go wrong, how hard can it be?&rdquo;. A couple of days later and I am busy writing the follow-up post to <a href="/2018/05/20/sp_execute_external_script-and-sql-compute-context---i/">sp_execute_external_script and SQL Compute Context - I</a> when I try to execute <code>sp_execute_external_script</code>, and it falls over!</p>

        <p>The last <a href="/2018/03/21/microsoft-sql-server-r-services---sp_execute_external_script---iii/">blog post</a> in the <a href="/sql_server_2k16_r_services">Microsoft SQL Server R Services</a> series covered some performance related parameters of <code>sp_execute_external_script</code>, (<code>@parallel</code> and <code>@r_rowsPerRead</code>), and it touched a little bit on <strong>SQL Server Compute Context</strong>.</p>

<p>After I published the post, I received an email from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/umachandarjayachandran/">Umachandar Jayachandran</a> who is a Principal Program Manager in the SQL Server team and is working on integration of R, Python and other runtimes into SQL Server (basically, he knows this &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;). In the mail, he said that I was somewhat incorrect in what I said about how the <strong>SQL Server Compute Context</strong> (SQLCC) works.</p>

<p>So I decided to write a post to correct my mistakes, and this is it. While I wrote this post I realized that there are more to the SQL compute context that meets ones eye, so I will - in all likelihood - write more posts about SQLCC.</p>

<p>To see other posts (including this) in the series, go to <a href="/spees_and_sql_compute_context"><strong>sp_execute_external_script and SQL Server Compute Context</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Before I begin I want to say a very big <strong>THANK YOU</strong> to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/umachandarjayachandran/">Umachandar</a> as well as <a href="https://twitter.com/nelliegson">Nellie Gustafsson</a> who also is a SQL Server Program Manager at Microsoft. Without them making me see the &ldquo;errors of my way&rdquo; I would not have been able to write this post.</p>

        <p>Back in the day when I started with the <strong>SQL Server R Services - Internals</strong> posts, I thought I would use <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb630354(v=sql.105).aspx">SQL Server Extended Events</a> (XEvents) to figure things out. I knew SQL Server and the extensibility architecture supported XEvents because I had come across <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/advanced-analytics/r/extended-events-for-sql-server-r-services">this</a> documentation, where it (amongst other things) said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>SQL Server provides a set of extended events to use in troubleshooting operations related to the SQL Server Trusted Launchpad, as well as Python or R jobs sent to SQL Server.</em>&ldquo;</p>

<p>From the above, it is pretty clear that XEvents is the way to go when drilling down into how things &ldquo;hang together&rdquo;. However, how hard I tried, I could not make &ldquo;head or tails&rdquo; of how to get things to work (I should probably have tried harder), so in the end, I went the <strong>WinDbg</strong> and <strong>WireShark</strong> route.</p>

<p>Fast forward a year (and a bit) and someone asked a question on an internal forum about XEvents and <strong>SQL Server Machine Learning Services</strong>, and I decided to look into it and to try to understand it a bit better. So this post is the result of me <del>playing around with</del> researching XEvents and SQL Server Machine Learning Services.</p>

        <p>This post is the 24:th post about <strong>Microsoft SQL Server R Services</strong>, and the third that covers <code>sp_execute_external_script</code>. I have thought many times that this series has reached its end, and I have many times realised I was wrong. Well, now I can say that this is the last post in the series! I started over a year ago (March 4 2017) with an idea about &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t it be cool if I wrote a couple of posts about <strong>Microsoft SQL Server R Services</strong>&rdquo;! Over one year and 24 posts later, here we are!</p>

<p>This last post talks about <code>sp_execute_external_script</code> and a parameter named <code>@parallel</code>. When we discuss this parameter, we also touch (a little bit) upon performance aspects of <code>sp_execute_external_script</code>.</p>

        <p>This is the 22:nd post in a series about <strong>Microsoft SQL Server R Services</strong>. This journey started about a year ago when I thought it would be a good idea to write a couple of blog posts about, what then went under the name of, Microsoft SQL Server 2016 R Services. Never in my wildest fantasies did I think I would write over 20 posts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Since the introduction of Microsoft SQL Server R Services, it has been renamed to <strong>Microsoft SQL Server Machine Learning Services</strong>.</p>

<p>This series began with a discussion about how to install Microsoft SQL Server R Services and continued with the internals of how it works internally in SQL Server and the launchpad service. Throughout the series, we have used <code>sp_execute_external_script</code> when investigating what goes on. So, I thought that having a couple of posts looking at <code>sp_execute_external_script</code> would be a good way to finish this series off, and this post is the first of three about <code>sp_execute_external_script</code>.</p>

        <p>This is the 21:th post in a series about <strong>Microsoft SQL Server R Services</strong>, (it is now called <strong>Microsoft SQL Server Machine Learning Services</strong>), and the 20:th post that drills down into the internal of how it works.</p>

<p>Wow, 20 posts about internals - when I started this <strong>Microsoft SQL Server R Services</strong> series, I thought I might achieve five or six posts. I would never have - in my wildest fantasies - thought I would reach twenty!</p>

<p>To see other posts (including this) in the series, go to <a href="/sql_server_2k16_r_services"><strong>SQL Server R Services</strong></a>.</p>

<p>We are however now coming closer to the end of this whole series, and this post is the last for <strong>Internals</strong>. After this post, I foresee one, possibly two, more posts about other things related to <strong>Microsoft SQL Server R Services</strong>  - and then we are done!</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This week there is very little content. This is because I&rsquo;ve been overseas - last Sunday I went to Gibraltar, and I came back yesterday (Saturday) evening. Gibraltar is an awesome place by the way. The downside of living in South Africa (as I do) is the travel time - Durban to Gib was a 25 hours door to door trip!</p>

The post was fairly long, and there were things that I wanted to cover which I didn&rsquo;t do due to the length of the post.</p>

<p>So this post is a continuation of <a href="/2017/11/25/microsoft-sql-server-r-services---internals-xiv/">Internals - XIV</a>.</p>

        <p>This is the 15:th post in a series about <strong>Microsoft SQL Server R Services</strong>, and the 14:th post that drills down into the internal of how it works.

<p>Finally, after a couple of false starts this post will look into the protocol used when transferring data back and forth between SQL Server and the SqlSatellite: <strong>Binary eXchange Language</strong> (<strong>BXL</strong>). Why write about it at all? Well, the big reason why I wanted to know more about it, was due to the strange packet sizes I saw when inspecting data being sent from SQL Server to the SqlSatellite: one row with 5 numeric columns had a packet size of 6300 bytes!!!</p>

<p>Sorry guys, in my last post <a href="/2017/10/31/microsoft-sql-server-r-services---internals-xii/">Internals - XII</a> I said we&rsquo;d - in this post - look into the <strong>Binary eXchange Language</strong> protocol(<strong>BXL</strong>) which is used when sending data from SQL Server to the SqlSatellite. The protocol is also involved when we send  one row of data containing 5 integers, and the packet size for that ends up being 6300 bytes.</p>

<p>Well, we won&rsquo;t look at that in this post, I was once again led astray when researching how data is sent.</p>

<p>The last few posts in this series has been about communication between SQL Server and SqlSatellite. We have discussed the connection between the two, and we have also seen how packets are sent from SQL Server to SqlSatellite. In this post we&rsquo;ll continue looking at what causes the packets to be send and what sends them. We will specifically look at the packet containing the external script, as well as the packet that contains the data (<code>@input_data_set_1</code>).</p>

<p>In the last <a href="/2017/08/29/microsoft-sql-server-r-services---internals-x/">post</a> we spoke about how the transfer of data happens between SQL Server and the R components, and we saw how data was transferred over the TCP connection between the <strong>SqlSatellite</strong> and SQL Server. In the post we mentioned that the protocol being used is  <strong>Binary eXchange Language</strong> protocol(<strong>BXL</strong>), and this post was supposed to talk about BXL.</p>

To see other posts (including this) in the series, go to <a href="/sql_server_2k16_r_services"><strong>SQL Server R Services</strong></a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="/2017/08/18/microsoft-sql-server-r-services---internals-ix/">Internals - IX</a> I said we were nearing the end of the internals part is this series, and I had planned this post to be the final post in the Internals part. However while investigating how data is sent between SQL Server and the external components I realized that I would need to probably do two more posts (apart from this) for Internals.</p>

<p>Anyway, in this post we&rsquo;ll see how data is sent to the R components from SQL Server.</p>

<p>We are now nearing the end of the Internals part of this series (you probably say &ldquo;about time&rdquo;). When I started this series way back in March this year, I thought that the Internals would be two, maximum three episodes. Boy was I wrong!</p>

<p>In this post we&rsquo;ll look at how the various components are communicating with each other.</p>

        <p>A little while ago I wrote a <a href="/2017/07/02/sql-server-2017-sqlclr-and-permissions/">blog-post</a> about the changes in the SQLCLR security model in SQL Server 2017. I wrote about how Microsoft has changed the relation between CAS and security boundaries, and CAS is no longer supported as a boundary! And also how Microsoft introduced an <code>sp_configure</code> option called <code>clr strict security</code>, which by default is set to 1 (on). When the setting is on, SQL Server treats all assemblies (<code>SAFE</code>, <code>EXTERNAL_ACCESS</code>, <code>UNSAFE</code>) as if they were marked <code>UNSAFE</code>.</p>

<p>The release I wrote the post against was CTP 2.1, and earlier this week Microsoft released SQL Server 2017 RC1. Some days ago I received a comment from <em>Paul Vestuto</em> on my <a href="/2017/07/02/sql-server-2017-sqlclr-and-permissions/">post</a>, pointing out that in RC1 there has been some more changes to the security model. I thought those changes would earn their own blog-post, instead of just editing the <a href="/2017/07/02/sql-server-2017-sqlclr-and-permissions/">previous post</a>.</p>

To see other posts (including this) in the series, go to: <a href="/sql_server_2k16_r_services"><strong>SQL Server R Services</strong></a></p>

<p>So far in this series we have been looking at what happens in SQL Server as well as the launchpad service when we execute <code>sp_execute_external_script</code>, and we have still no real &ldquo;clue&rdquo; to where the R engine comes into play.</p>

<p>Well, hopefully that will change (at least a little bit) with this post, as we here will look at what happens when we leave the launchpad service.</p>

        <p>While I was writing the post about <a href="/2017/07/01/sqlclr-and-certificates/">SQLCLR and Certificates</a>, I came across some strange behavior when I accidentally ran my code on an SQL Server 2017 instance. I quickly connected back to my SQL Server 2016 instance and continued. However, afterwards I started to look into the differences between SQLCLR in SQL Server 2017 and SQL Server 2016, and this post is the result of me <del>playing around</del> investigating the changes.</p>

        <p>This post originates, like the one about <a href="/2017/06/25/creating-r-stored-procedures-in-sql-server-2016-using-sqlrutils/">sqlrutils</a>, from a question on a Microsoft forum - this time the <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/sqlserver/en-US/home?forum=sqlnetfx">.NET Framework inside SQL Server</a> forum. As the name implies, the forum cover questions about the usage of SQLCLR (.NET inside SQL Server), and the <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/sqlserver/en-US/35b8bce5-8ea9-4fd4-aa87-1764a2071e92/long-lasting-pfx-file-for-sqlclr-externalaccess-signing?forum=sqlnetfx">question</a> was about signing of SQLCLR assemblies in order to assigning other permission sets than <code>SAFE</code> to the assembly.</p>

<p>As I, back in the day, taught SQLCLR as part of Developmentor&rsquo;s SQL Server curriculum, I thought that it&rsquo;d be interesting if I tried to answer the question, and also make a blog-post about it. That way I&rsquo;d remember what to do the next time the question came up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> In another post, I wrote this about Developmentor: <em>Developmentor were back in the day THE training company to go to if you wanted highly, highly technical training about COM, .NET, SQL Server, etc. <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/article/2073792/core-java/a-eulogy--developmentor--rip.html">This article</a> by my old colleague <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/">Ted Neward</a> (@tedneward) sums DM up quite accurately (apart from the fact that DM hadn&rsquo;t closed its doors when the article was written, ooops).</em> Ted was probably more accurate than he at the time thought, since DM went out of business somewhat later.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyway, let&rsquo;s see what this is all about&hellip;</p>

Oh, and this blog-post would never have seen the light of the day, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for the original poster of the question: <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/profile/jd%20long/">JD Long</a>, thanks JD!</p>

<p>So, what is SQL Server R stored procedures and what is <strong>sqlrutils</strong>?</p>

        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series">Time series</a> data is being used more and more in all industries, and of course we want to be able to forecast and predict future values. There are however a variety of challenges that come with producing a large number of forecasts across a variety of time series.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://research.fb.com/category/data-science/">Facebook&rsquo;s data science team</a> has worked with time series forecasting for quite a while, and recently they open-sourced an internal tool for this type of forecasting: <a href="https://facebookincubator.github.io/prophet/">Facebook Prophet</a>.</p>

<p>Recently there was a post on the Microsoft R Server forum if it was possible to use Prophet with Microsoft R Server, so I thought I&rsquo;d test it out. This post covers how to use it, both from a standalone Microsoft R Server as well as SQL Server R Services.</p>

<p>The <a href="/2017/04/23/microsoft-sql-server-r-services---internals-iv/">Internals - IV</a> post came about due to an email from Bob Albright (<a href="https://twitter.com/bob_albright">@bob_albright</a>), pointing me to some resources (a blog-post) regarding the processes the launchpad service creates.</p>

<p>In his email Bob also, kindly enough, attached some code. The code highlighted some behavior when creating the RTerm processes, especially around parallelism. In this blog-post we&rsquo;ll follow up on that and look into the effect parallelism has on process creation.</p>

<p>In <a href="/2017/04/13/microsoft-sql-server-r-services---internals-iii/">Internals - III</a>, I wrote about how the launchpad service creates multiple processes when executing an external script.</p>

<p>Seeing that some of the conclusions I came to was somewhat educated guesses, I asked you guys to correct me where I was in-correct and/or add more information. After that post - Bob Albright (<a href="https://twitter.com/bob_albright">@bob_albright</a>) - wrote me an email and pointed me to some resources around process creation, as well as some demo code. Thanks Bob!</p>

<p>So today we&rsquo;ll drill even further into the creation of processes, and see how they are used.</p>

        <p>On April 19, 2017 Microsoft held an on-line conference <strong>Microsoft Data Amp</strong> to showcase how Microsoft’s latest innovations put data, analytics and artificial intelligence at the heart of business transformation. The keynotes speakers were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Guthrie">Scott &ldquo;Red Shirt&rdquo; Guthrie</a> who is an <em>Microsoft Executive Vice President</em> (fairly high on the food-chain), and <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Profile/Joseph%20Sirosh">Joseph Sirosh</a> a <em>Corporate Vice President</em>, head of the Information Management and Machine Learning group. Joseph probably knows a thing or two about data, and Scott - well, Scott knows <strong>A LOT</strong>!</p>

<p>During the keynotes, Scott and Joseph shared how Microsoft’s latest innovations put data, analytics and artificial intelligence at the heart of business transformation. A big enabler for this is <strong>SQL Server 2017</strong> (the &ldquo;artist&rdquo; formerly known as SQL Server V.Next), which introduces a lot of very cool new &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The keynote speeches were followed by recorded short:ish sessions drilling down into certain aspects of Microsoft&rsquo;s new offerings. If you are interested in the various presentations at <strong>Microsoft Data Amp</strong>, they all are on <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Data-Science/Microsoft-Data-Amp-2017">Channel 9</a>.</p>

<p>What caught my eye was the announcement of how <strong>SQL Server 2017</strong> now supports Python as an extensible script engine. When Microsoft introduced support for R in SQL Server 2016, rumors immediately surfaced how other engines also would be supported, where Python was high on the list (<a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> another one).</p>

<p>Seeing that I am somewhat into <strong>SQL Server R Services</strong> (the SQL Server 2016 flavor) <a href="/2017/03/04/microsoft-sql-server-2016-r-services-installation/">here</a>, <a href="/2017/03/18/microsoft-sql-server-r-services---internals-i/">here</a>, <a href="/2017/04/02/microsoft-sql-server-r-services---internals-ii/">here</a>, <a href="/2017/04/13/microsoft-sql-server-r-services---internals-iii/">here</a>, and more posts to come, I really had to have a look.</p>

<p>The rest of this post is a brief introduction to executing Python code in <strong>SQL Server 2017</strong>, in essence I just want to be able to execute some sort of Python code.</p>

<p>This post was initially to be about the R runtime, and what other parts are involved when executing R scripts in SQL Server. However, during my &ldquo;spelunking&rdquo; around I realized that I did not really understand what happens when we create the processes for the R runtime from the launchpad service and the launcher (which is what I covered in the <a href="/2017/04/02/microsoft-sql-server-r-services---internals-ii/">internals II post</a>).</p>

<p>So, instead of looking at the R runtime and the other R related components, we&rsquo;ll look at what happens when creating external processes. A subsequent blog-post will cover the R runtime and components.</p>

To see other posts (including this) in the series, go to <a href="/sql_server_2k16_r_services"><strong>SQL Server R Services</strong></a>.</p>

<p>In the <a href="/2017/03/18/microsoft-sql-server-r-services---internals-i/">previous internals post</a> we looked at what happens inside the SQL Server engine when  we execute <code>sp_execute_external_script</code>. In that post we wrapped up when we reached the launchpad service (<em>Launchpad.exe</em>). This post will look closer at the launchpad service, and we will do it by some more &ldquo;spelunking&rdquo;</p>

To see other posts (including this) in the series, go to <a href="/sql_server_2k16_r_services"><strong>SQL Server R Services</strong></a>.</p>

<p>In this post, and one or two more we will look at what goes on under the covers when we execute some R code inside SQL Server. This post looks at quite in detail what happens in the SQL engine when we execute <code>sp_execute_external_script</code>.</p>

<p>To try and get an understanding we&rsquo;ll do something that we did quite a lot back in the day when I worked at Developmentor; we&rsquo;ll <a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=945136">&ldquo;spelunk&rdquo;</a> the SQL Server code via <em>WinDbg</em>. This can be really useful when trying to understand and get to grips with new technology/functionality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Developmentor were back in the day THE training company to go to if you wanted highly, highly technical training about COM, .NET, SQL Server, etc. <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/article/2073792/core-java/a-eulogy--developmentor--rip.html">This article</a> by my old colleague <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/">Ted Neward</a> (@tedneward) sums DM up quite accurately (apart from the fact that DM hadn&rsquo;t closed its doors when the article was written, ooops).</p>

        <p>A couple of weeks beck I wrote a <a href="/2017/02/25/microsoft-r-server/">blog-post where I compared CRAN R with Microsoft R Server</a>. The comparison was basically how large data sets are handled. In the post I mentioned that SQL Server 2016 (and later) is the delivery mechanism for Microsoft R Server on the Windows platform. In this post we will look at how to install and enable SQL Server R Services.</p>

<p>This post is the first in a series of posts about SQL Server R Services and to see other posts (including this) in the series, go to <a href="/sql_server_2k16_r_services"><strong>SQL Server R Services</strong></a>.</p>

        <p>Last Saturday (February 18) I was in Cape Town at the second world-wide <a href="http://capetown2017.satrdays.org/">satRday conference</a> ever, where I gave a talk named: &ldquo;Microsoft, Open Source, R: You gotta be kidding me!&ldquo;. The talk was about Microsoft&rsquo;s R Server offering, and how it in some cases offered a better performance than Open R. Seeing the session lengths were only 20 minutes, I could not show any code, so in a &ldquo;weak&rdquo; moment I promised to put the code up on my web-site together with an accompanying blog-post. This is it :).</p>

Seeing that we do that a lot at <a href="/Derivco">Derivco</a>, I came with some suggestions, and also said that I was writing a blog-post about how it can be done.

        <p>Just to set things straight, the title of this post has nothing to do with US politics, but the infinitely more important (and exciting) subject of transactions in <strong>SQL Server</strong> and the concept of <strong>doomed</strong> transactions. Why I came across the idea for this post was due to a discussion I had with a colleague of mine - Sameer Chunilall - who didn&rsquo;t agree with my <a href="/2017/01/08/abort-abort-we-are-xact_aborting-or-are-we/">post</a> a while ago about <code>XACT_ABORT</code>, he believes it is a good thing (mostly), where I believe it is a bad thing (mostly).</p>

<p>This is the &ldquo;roundup&rdquo; of the posts that has been most interesting to me. Oh, and if you wonder if you have missed <em>Interesting Stuff - Week #1</em>. seeing that this post is named <em>Interesting Stuff - Week #2</em>, you haven&rsquo;t. They are numbered by calendar week number, and I started the second week of January :).</p>

        <p><code>SET XACT_ABORT</code> defines whether a transaction is automatically rolled back when a T-SQL statement raises a run-time exception, and when you read posts from prominent SQL bloggers you quite often see that they recommend to always have <code>XACT_ABORT</code> set to <code>ON</code>. From the title of this post you may get the impression that I do not necessarily agree, and to an extent you may be right. So, let us see &hellip;</p>

        <p>Way back when (in 2010 as a matter of fact), I wrote a couple of blog-posts (<a href="/2010/11/10/new-t-sql-features-in-sql-11-/-denali---error-handling/">here</a> and <a href="/2010/11/12/more-t-sql-error-functionality-in-denali-/-sql-11/">here</a>) about error handling in the new CTP  releases of SQL Server Denali. Denali was what would become SQL Server 2012.</p>

<p>The new functionality built upon what was introduced in SQL Server 2005 - the notion of structured exception handling through <code>BEGIN TRY END TRY</code> followed by <code>BEGIN CATCH END CATCH</code>. In those blog-posts I was fairly positive, and saw the new functionality as something useful and very well worth implementing. I am still positive, however since then I have used the new functionality introduced in SQL Server 2005 extensively in production and have come across some gotchas that I thought would be worth writing a blog-post about.</p>

        <p>What can I say, I am crap at this &ldquo;blogging&rdquo; thing! Three years ago, I <a href="/2013/10/02/moving-to-a-new-blog-engine/">resuscitated my blog</a>, after a hiatus of one year. I also switched blog engine from WordPress to <a href="http://octopress.org"><strong>OctoPress</strong></a> (which at that stage was version 2). At the time of the switch, I had had a one year hiatus of blogging (I am not a very prolific blog writer :)), and I remember I was very tempted to write in that <a href="/2013/10/02/moving-to-a-new-blog-engine/">post</a>, that if I cannot keep up blogging I will quit. Boy, am I glad I did not write that!</p>

        <p>In an earlier <a href="/2013/10/02/moving-to-a-new-blog-engine/">post</a>, I wrote how I had changed blog-engine from WordPress to <a href="http://octopress.org/"><strong>OctoPress</strong></a>. At the moment I am running Windows as my main OS (mostly due to work related requirements), and - as OctoPress is very much Ruby and Python based - there are certain things to be aware of when installing this on Windows. Furthermore, my blog is now hosted on <strong>Windows Azure</strong> - so, with all this in mind, I thought I&rsquo;d put together a blog post about the set-up of OctoPress on Windows, running on Windows Azure.</p>

        Every so often I get an itch, and I want to try out a new blog-platform. The time has now come to leave my self-hosted WordPress and move on to something &ldquo;geekier&rdquo; (I am a geek after all).
I have just now finished moving my few posts from WordPress to the new engine: OctoPress. In a future blog post on the new blog I will try to explain why I made the move, and why OctoPress.

        <p>I have a while ago just finished watching the live stream of the first keynote (yes there will be one tomorrow as well), at Microsoft BUILD. Having attended / presented, at quite a few of these kind of events - and being somewhat jaded (well OK then, a lot jaded), I must still say that I am impressed.</p>

        <p>Transactions in SQL Server seems to be a difficult topic to grasp. This weekend I came across a blog-post where the poster showed a &ldquo;solution&rdquo; to the &ldquo;The ROLLBACK TRANSACTION request has no corresponding BEGIN TRANSACTION&rdquo; error we sometimes see when various stored procedures call each other. The solution (even though it masked out the error in question) did not get it quite right. So I thought I would make a post about the subject.</p>

        So yesterday I wrote about how I have started using F# and Mono on my MacBook.
I wrote about how I downloaded the F# bits, unzipped and put them in a specific directory I had created. Today after having browsed around a bit more I realized I had done it the hard way. To install the required bits for F# for Mac, you only have to download a zip file with an install package for Mac from the F# Cross Platform site on CodePlex.

        <p>This is a first post about my experiences with running F# and Mono on a Mac.</p>

<p>In a <a href="/2010/11/15/using-f#-in-sqlclr/">previous post</a> I wrote about how I have started to play with F#. As that post also covered SQLCLR it was obvious I was on Windows. Even though I make my living from development in a Windows environment, my main machine is a MacBook, and I run OSX as my main OS. I have previously also been running Linux (ArchLinux) on this machine as my main OS. Naturally I have heard about Mono (and also installed it a couple of times - and quickly un-installed again, but I have not really done anything with it. I have always run Windows in a VM on my MacBook for development etc. However after the announcement that F# was going <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dsyme/archive/2010/11/04/announcing-the-f-compiler-library-source-code-drop.aspx">Open Source</a>, and <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog">Tomas P</a> <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-in-monodevelop.aspx">posted</a> about his F# MonoDevelop plug-in</a>, I decided that I should have a look at what it would be like to do F# &ldquo;stuff in OSX.</p>

        <p>Recently I have become very interested in F# and I am at the moment trying to get to grips with it. It is definitely a different beast than C#, but so far I like it - a lot!</p>

<p>Anyway, I am a SQL nerd, and many moons ago I was very heavily involved in SQLCLR (for you who don&rsquo;t know what that is; it is the ability to run .NET code inside the SQL Server engine. It was first introduced with SQL Server 2005). So I thought it would be a &ldquo;giggle&rdquo; to see if I could get some F# code running inside SQL Server.</p>

        <p>.. from a relational developers perspective!!</p>

<p>Well, the title may be a bit harsh, but at least it grabbed your attention - did it not?!</p>

<p>A week ago, or so, I wrote a <a href="/2010/11/07/what-new-programmability-features-will-there-be-in-sql-11/">wish list</a> to Santa for Denali from a relational developers perspective. In that wish list I wrote that there has been fairly little love for relational SQL developers in the recent versions of SQL Server, and that I hoped in this version (i.e Denali) Microsoft would &ldquo;go back to the roots&rdquo; and give us developers some new stuff.</p>

        This post is more as a reminder to myself where to find online resources when learning F#. If anyone else can find it useful, so much better. And, if anyone out there has other online, resources, please leave a comment and I will include it. So, in no particular order:
 Introductory article by Luke Hoban in MSDN Magazine. An online book about F#. Tutorial, by Dejan Jelovic, about getting started with F# from a C# developers perspective.

I have literally finished installing the next version of SQL Server (Denali / SQL 11) on a new VM, like 10 minutes ago, and I have done a quick check of the new features of SQL Server Denali (what I could find at least) against my <a href="/2010/11/07/what-new-programmability-features-will-there-be-in-sql-11/">wish-list</a>.</p>

        So yesterday I posted my wish-list for new programmability features in the upcoming release of SQL 11 / Denali.
Today I see that Simon S has posted about a new series of posts he will do, covering what is new in SQL 11. Knowing Simon, it will be really, really good. So if you are interested I suggest you keep your eyes open for his posts.
UPDATE: Ben C commented and said that CTP1 has been released (or something to that effect), and here is where it can be downloaded from.

        <p>There is probably no secret that Microsoft is working hard on next version of SQL Server. The rumour has it that it will be named SQL 11 (it apparently goes under the code name of Denali. Quiz; MS has used the Denali code name previously, what was it for? Answers in the comments ).</p>

        <p>This is a re-post from my previous blog. However, as that blog has now gone to the big blog repository in the sky (or wherever blogs go to when they are no more), I decided to repost this, seeing how <strong>CEP</strong> and <strong>StreamInsight</strong> are becoming more and more popular.</p>

        <p>Yesterday I downloaded and installed the August CTP of SQL Server 2008 R2, and today I played around with it for a while. So, what are my impressions?</p>

        As the saying goes; &ldquo;It is hard to learn an old dog new tricks&rdquo;, but&hellip; Even though I am a really old dog, I hope I&rsquo;ll be able to learn a bit about &ldquo;social networking&rdquo;, and therefore I created an account on Twitter a couple of days ago. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll be able to be more active on Twitter than what I&rsquo;ve been here at the blog. Well, that should not be too hard, seeing how infrequent I post here.

        <p>As good as SQL 2005 was (well, still are), one disappointment was that you needed Visual Studio if you wanted to debug your stored procedures. Seriously, what was MS thinking when they did that, especially as in SQL 2000, Query Analyzer had debug capabilities?!!</p>

        <p>One of the first thing I usually do after having installed a new version of SQL Server is to snoop around at the system tables to see what new tables there are and what they can give me information about.</p>
