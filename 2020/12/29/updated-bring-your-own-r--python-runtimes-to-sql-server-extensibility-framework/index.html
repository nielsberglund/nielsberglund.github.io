<p>Back in the day I wrote quite a few blog posts about <a href="https://nielsberglund.com/categories/sql-server-machine-learning-services/"><strong>SQL Server Machine Learning Services</strong></a> as well as <a href="https://nielsberglund.com/categories/sql-server-extensibility-framework/"><strong>SQL Server Extensibility Framework</strong></a>, and <a href="https://nielsberglund.com/categories/sql-server-extensibility-framework/"><strong>External Languages</strong></a>. <strong>SQL Server Machine Learning Services</strong> is very cool, but a complaint has been that you are restricted in what versions of R and Python you use.</p>

<p>In September 2020, Microsoft <a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2020/09/24/open-sourcing-the-r-and-python-language-extensions-for-sql-server/">announced</a> that they have open-sourced the technology behind SQL Server Extensibility Framework. As a result, we can now bring our own versions of R and Python to SQL Server 2019.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> To bring your own R/Python you need SQL Server 2019 CU3 or above.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this blog post, we look at how to do that.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>In SQL Server 2016, Microsoft introduced SQL Server R Services. From inside SQL Server, that allowed you to call to the R engine via a special procedure, <code>sp_execute_external_script</code>, and execute R scripts.</p>

<p>In SQL Server 2017, Microsoft added Python as an external language and renamed SQL Server R Services to SQL Server Machine Learning Services. As with R, you execute your Python scripts using <code>sp_execute_external_script</code>.</p>

<p>Both the R runtime and the Python runtime are part of the SQL Server install, but they run as an external process. The runtimes are based on the open-source versions, but they have some Microsoft proprietary additions. The communication between SQL Server and the external engine goes over the <em>Launchpad</em> service:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/byor-r-and-p-launchpad1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> <em>External Script and Language</em></p>

<p>We see in <em>Figure 1</em> how:</p>

<ol>
<li>We execute the procedure <code>sp_execute_external_script</code>, notice the <code>@language</code> parameter.</li>
<li>That calls into the <em>Launchpad</em> service.</li>
<li>The <em>Launchpad</em> service passes the script into the relevant launcher based on the <code>@language</code> parameter in <code>sp_execute_external_script</code>. The knowledge of what launcher to call lives inside of the <em>Launchpad</em> service.</li>
<li>The launcher dll, a C++ dll, loads the relevant external engine and passes the script to the engine and executes.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you want to know more about R and Python&rsquo;s implementation in SQL Server, I suggest you look at the link above about <a href="https://nielsberglund.com/categories/sql-server-machine-learning-services/"><strong>SQL Server Machine Learning Services</strong></a>.</p>

<h4 id="java">Java</h4>

<p>In CTP 2.0 of SQL Server 2019, Microsoft made Java publicly available as an external language together with R and Python. Having Java as an external language may not seem that much different from R/Python, but there are some differences:</p>

<ul>
<li>Java is a compiled language, where we call into a specific method. R/Python are scripting languages where we send a script to the engine.</li>
<li>R/Python are part of the SQL Server install, together with launcher dll&rsquo;s and so forth. There is an equivalent of a launcher dll for Java, (<code>javaextension.dll</code>), which calls into the JVM. The difference here between R/Python and Java is that the JVM is not part of the SQL Server install but must be installed separately.</li>
</ul>

<p>Microsoft could have done with the Java integration in SQL Server 2019 to just treat it as R/Python, and &ldquo;hardcode&rdquo; Java as a language in the <em>Launchpad</em> service and let the <em>Launchpad</em> service call the <code>javaextension.dll</code>.</p>

<p>However, Microsoft did not &ldquo;hack&rdquo; the <em>Launchpad</em> service, but what they did was, with the view to &ldquo;properly&rdquo; expose an extensibility framework with multiple external languages, that they introduced a new &ldquo;host&rdquo; for external languages: <code>ExtHost.exe</code>. The <em>Launchpad</em> service calls this host for all languages except the built-in R/Python:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/byor-r-and-p-launchpad2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 2:</strong> <em>External Host</em></p>

<p>In <em>Figure 2</em> we see how:</p>

<ol>
<li>We execute the procedure <code>sp_execute_external_script</code>, with <code>Java</code> being the value of the <code>@language</code> parameter.</li>
<li>The proc calls into the <em>Launchpad</em> service as above.</li>
<li>Since the <code>@language</code> parameter is not <code>R</code> or <code>Python</code>, the <em>Launchpad</em> service call into <code>ExtHost.exe</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>ExtHost.exe</code> calls a well-known entry point in the language extension dll.</li>
<li>The language extension dll loads the external runtime and executes the code.</li>
</ol>

<p>OK, the above does not seem that different from R/Python, but hang on a minute? With R and Python the <em>Launchpad</em> service knows about the launchers, (language extension dll&rsquo;s), what about step 4 above; how does the <em>ExternalHost</em> know which language extension to call?</p>

<h4 id="external-language">External Language</h4>

<p>The answer to the question above is <code>EXTERNAL LANGUAGE</code>. When Microsoft introduced Java, they also introduced the notion of an external language. The external language is the path, (or bytes), to a zip file containing the language extension dll. So in the case of Java, it is the path to the zip file where <code>javaextension.dll</code> is:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">CREATE EXTERNAL LANGUAGE Java
FROM (CONTENT = 'W:\javaextension.zip'
      , FILE_NAME = 'javaextension.dll');
GO
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 1:</strong> <em>Creating External Language</em></p>

<p>In <em>Code Snippet 1</em>, we set the file name in the <code>FILE_NAME</code> parameter because the zip file may contain multiple files and the file name defines the language extension.</p>

<p>When Microsoft introduced external languages, they also introduced some new system catalog views:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>sys.external_languages</code> - contains a row for each external language in the database.</li>
<li><code>sys.external_language_files</code> - contains a row for each external language extension file in the database.</li>
</ul>

<p>You use the catalog views above to see what external languages exist in a database.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> External languages are database scoped.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="https://nielsberglund.com/categories/sql-server-extensibility-framework/"><strong>External Languages</strong></a> link above has links to blog posts to get more information about external languages.</p>

<h4 id="recap">Recap</h4>

<p>So to recap the <em>Background</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>The R and Python runtimes have Microsoft specific additions, and they are installed together with SQL Server. The launchers are closed source C++ dll&rsquo;s.</li>
<li>The Java language extension, (&ldquo;launcher&rdquo;), is closed source - but you are not tied to a Java version. Well, the version has to be 8+.</li>
<li>When using Java, the language extension needs to be registered and tied to the language.</li>
</ul>

<p>This was the &ldquo;lie of the land&rdquo; up until September this year, (2020).</p>

<h2 id="open-source">Open Source</h2>

<p>When Java became a supported language in SQL Server 2019, Microsoft mentioned that communication between <em>ExternalHost</em> and the language extension should be based on an API, regardless of the external language. The API is the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/language-extensions/reference/extensibility-framework-api?view=sql-server-ver15">Extensibility Framework API for SQL Server</a>. Having an API ensures simplicity and ease of use for the extension developer.</p>

<p><strong>Start edit: edited when Java was open-sourced</strong></p>

<p>From the paragraph above, one can assume that Microsoft would like to see 3rd party development of language extensions. That assumption turned out to be accurate as, Microsoft open-sourced the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-language-extensions/tree/master/language-extensions/java">Java language extension</a>, together with the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-language-extensions/tree/master/extension-host/include">include files for the extension API</a>, in <del>September</del> March 2020! This means that anyone interested can now create a language extension for their own favorite language!</p>

<p><del>However, open sourcing the Java extension was not the only thing Microsoft did.</del> Furthermore, in September 2020,  they also created and open-sourced language extensions for R and Python!</p>

<p><strong>End Edit</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Microsoft did not open-source the R and Python launcher dll&rsquo;s, but they developed new extensions which do not require the Microsoft implementation of the R and Python runtimes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, if you are on SQL Server 2019 CU3+, you can now bring your own R and Python runtimes to SQL server. In the rest of this post, we look at bringing a Python runtime to SQL Server 2019.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> In this post we bring our own Python runtime, but there is no difference if you want to install an R runtime instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="pre-reqs">Pre-reqs</h2>

<p>Before we dive into the &ldquo;nitty-gritty&rdquo;, let&rsquo;s look at what you need in order to bring your own Python runtime to SQL server.</p>

<h4 id="sql-server-2019">SQL Server 2019</h4>

<p>Well, duh - that&rsquo;s quite obvious. However, don&rsquo;t forget you need to be on CU3 or above, (in this post I use CU4). Ensure that <em>Machine Learning Services and Language Extensions</em> are installed, (or part of the installation):</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/byor-r-and-p-install.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 3:</strong> <em>Installation Machine Learning Services and Language Extensions</em></p>

<p>As we will use our own Python runtime, we only check the <em>Machine Learning Services and Language Extensions</em> checkbox during installation or upgrade, as in <em>Figure 3</em>. That ensures that the <em>Launchpad</em> service and <code>ExtHost.exe</code> are installed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you already have installed the Microsoft R/Python runtimes the necessary, Microsoft proprietary, extensions are there. Also, you can run &ldquo;your&rdquo; R/Python runtime side by side with the Microsoft ones.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If this is a new installation of SQL Server you also need to enable the execution of external scripts:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">EXEC sp_configure 'external scripts enabled', 1
RECONFIGURE WITH OVERRIDE;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 2:</strong> <em>Enable Execution of External Scripts</em></p>

<p>As we see in <em>Code Snippet 2</em> we use <code>sp_configure</code> to enable external script execution.</p>

<p>When we use external languages; Java, etc., the languages are databased scoped. So the code we see in <em>Code Snippet 1</em> needs to be run in any database you want to use Java.</p>

<p>Let us create a database to use for our Python runtime:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">USE Master;
GO

IF EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM sys.databases WHERE name = 'ExtLangDB')
BEGIN
  DROP DATABASE 'ExtLangDB'
END
GO

CREATE DATABASE ExtLangDB;
GO
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 3:</strong> <em>Creating Database</em></p>

<p>After creating the database, as in <em>Code Snippet 3</em>, we can look at Python&rsquo;s base requirements.</p>

<h4 id="python">Python</h4>

<p>Another duh! But, let us talk about why we would like to use a different runtime. One reason could be using a more recent version of the runtime than the Microsoft provided runtime. I mentioned above that I am using SQL Server 2019 CU4 in this post. When I installed SQL Server, I chose to install the Microsoft provided runtimes for R and Python. I check the version like so:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">EXEC sp_execute_external_script
@language =N'Python',
@script=N'
import pandas as pd
import sys
df = pd.DataFrame(columns=[&quot;Version&quot;])
ver = sys.version
df = df.append({&quot;Version&quot;: ver}, ignore_index=True)
OutputDataSet = df'
WITH RESULT SETS (([Python Version] nvarchar(256)));
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 4:</strong> <em>Version Check Python</em></p>

<p>In <em>Code Snippet 4</em> I use Python&rsquo;s <code>sys.version</code> to get the version, and I add that to data frame. The data frame is then assigned to the return dataset represented by <code>OutputDataSet</code>. The result when we execute:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/byor-r-and-p-python-version-l.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 4:</strong> <em>Python Version</em></p>

<p>The version of Python, as we see in <em>Figure 4</em> is 3.7.1. For some reason or another, I would like to use 3.7.9. So we need to ensure we have Python 3.7.9 <a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2020/09/24/open-sourcing-the-r-and-python-language-extensions-for-sql-server/">downloaded</a> and installed on the SQL Server box.</p>

<p><strong>Start edit: following NOTE added 2021-01-09</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> When installing Python you need install it with administrator permissions: &ldquo;Run as administrator&rdquo;. The top level Python directory as well as the <code>.\Scripts</code> directory needs to be added to the <code>PATH</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>End Edit</strong></p>

<p>After you have installed Python install the <code>pandas</code> module, as it is not installed by default: <code>pip install pandas</code>.</p>

<h2 id="python-language-extension">Python Language Extension</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, the language extensions for Java, R, and Python are open-sourced, so you can download the source code and build them yourself. However, for now, we&rsquo;ll use <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-language-extensions/releases">prebuilt binaries</a>.</p>

<p>Browse to the Python language extension page, and download the version for your platform. For me, it is <code>python-lang-extension-windows.zip</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> On the page there are both release and debug versions of the extension. Use the release version in production!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Download to somewhere SQL Server has access to. In my case, I downloaded it to the root of my <code>w:\</code> drive.</p>

<p>When the extension is downloaded, it is time to register/install the extension.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>Before we register the extension, let us see what the zip file contains:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/byor-r-and-p-python-pythonextension.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 5:</strong> <em>Python Extension</em></p>

<p>When I open the zip file I see it contains one file, <code>pythonextension.dll</code> - as in <em>Figure 5</em>. Knowing the file name is good as we need to supply that when we register the external extension, like in <em>Code Snippet 1</em>.</p>

<p>So, let&rsquo;s do it, let&rsquo;s register the Python extension in the database we created in <em>Code Snippet 3</em>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">USE ExtLangDB;
GO

CREATE EXTERNAL LANGUAGE p379
FROM (CONTENT = 'W:\python-lang-extension-windows.zip'
      , FILE_NAME = 'pythonextension.dll');
GO
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 5:</strong> <em>Create Python Language</em></p>

<p>In <em>Code Snippet 5</em> we see how I:</p>

<ul>
<li>name the language <code>p379</code>. I cannot name it Python, or R, as they are reserved for Microsoft R and Python.</li>
<li>point to the path of the zip file.</li>
<li>say what file in the zip file is the extension dll.</li>
</ul>

<p>After I have executed the code I can check that it succeeded by: <code>SELECT * FROM sys.external_languages</code>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/byor-r-and-p-python-ext-langs.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 6:</strong> <em>External Languages</em></p>

<p>We can see from <em>Figure 6</em>, (outlined in red), that we succeeded in creating our own Python based external language. We also see R and Python as external languages.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You see R and Python as external languages regardless if you have installed them or not. Even if you haven&rsquo;t ticked the box for <em>Machine Learning Services and Language Extensions</em> checkbox, you will see R and Python.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cool, let us execute the code in <em>Code Snippet 4</em>, and see what happens. Before we run the code, change the <code>@language</code> parameter to be <code>p379</code> instead of <code>Python</code>, and then execute.</p>

<p>Hmm, bummer we get a very un-informative error along the lines of:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/byor-r-and-p-python-exec-error2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 7:</strong> <em>Error</em></p>

<p>In <em>Figure 7</em> we see the error message with a result of <code>0x8004004</code>. The <code>HRESULT 0x8004004</code> is <code>E_ABORT</code>, which doesn&rsquo;t really tell us anything - I did say the error was not very informative.</p>

<p>So, it turns out that when installing Python, (as well as R), we need to do some extra steps so the <em>Launchpad</em> service and <em>ExtHost</em> can do its things.</p>

<h4 id="path-permissions">Path &amp; Permissions</h4>

<p><strong>Start edit: edited around paths and environment variables 2021-01-09</strong></p>

<p><del>When we execute <code>sp_execute_external_script</code> and after <em>ExternalHost</em> has loaded the python extension dll, the extension needs to know where Python is installed, so it looks for an environment variable named <code>PYTHONHOME</code>. So the first thing we need to do is to create that variable as a system variable:</del></p>

<p>When we execute <code>sp_execute_external_script</code> and after <em>ExternalHost</em> has loaded the python extension dll, the extension needs to know where the Python runtime is. For this it uses the <code>PATH</code> variable on the SQL Server box. The extension knows which version of Python it is as the extension is compiled against a specific version, (more about that below). So, as mentioned above we need to ensure that Python is on the <code>PATH</code>.</p>

<p>When executing code, the <em>Launchpad</em> service needs to read and write to the Python directory, so we need to set permissions for that:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">icacls &lt;python-path&gt; /grant &quot;NT Service\MSSQLLAUNCHPAD$INST2&quot;:(OI)(CI)RX /T
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 6:</strong> <em>Grant Permissions to Launchpad</em></p>

<p>We need to run the code in <em>Code Snippet 6</em> from an elevated command prompt, (Powershell will not work). Notice in <em>Code Snippet 6</em> how I define the instance with <code>$instance_name</code>. If you do this for the default instance the command is without <code>$instance_name</code>, like so: <code>icacls &quot;&lt;python-path&gt; /grant &quot;NT Service\MSSQLLAUNCHPAD&quot;:(OI)(CI)RX /T</code>.</p>

<p>Having granted read and execute access to the <em>Launchpad</em> service for the instance, we do the same for the <code>ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES</code> group, which is represented by the <code>SID</code> <code>S-1-15-2-1</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">icacls &lt;python-path&gt; /grant *S-1-15-2-1:(OI)(CI)RX /T
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 7:</strong> <em>Grant Permissions to ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES</em></p>

<p><strong>End Edit</strong></p>

<p>The code in <em>Code Snippet 7</em>, which needs to be run from an elevated command prompt, grants read and execute permissions to the <code>ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES</code> group.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You can read more about <code>ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES</code>, and why we need it, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/machine-learning/install/sql-server-machine-learning-services-2019?view=sql-server-ver15">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After you have granted the necessary permissions, restart the <em>Launchpad</em> service, and rerun the code:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/byor-r-and-p-python-version-2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 8:</strong> <em>Python 3.7.9</em></p>

<p>Wohoo, as we see in <em>Figure 8</em>, it works! We are now using version 3.7.9 of Python!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you run the code on a Windows 10 20H2 version you may get an error along the lines of <em>The current Numpy installation (&lt;path to numpy) fails to pass a sanity check due to a bug in the windows runtime</em>. As the error says, it is an issue with Windows and <code>Numpy</code>. The easiest way to fix it is to downgrade <code>Numpy</code> to version <code>1.19.3</code>. You do it like so: <code>pip install --upgrade numpy==1.19.3</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Start edit: editing around <code>PYTHONHOME</code></strong></p>

<p>When looking at the official <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/machine-learning/install/custom-runtime-python">Microsoft documentation for the Python language extension</a> it mentions we need to add a system environment variable <code>PYTHONHOME</code>, what is that?</p>

<h4 id="pythonhome">PYTHONHOME</h4>

<p>Initially I thought the <code>PYTHONHOME</code> variable was used by the extension host to find the Python runtime, but that is not entirely correct. The <code>PYTHONHOME</code> variable is used when creating external libraries for the external Python language. So if you are only calling <code>sp_execute_external_script</code> the variable is not needed.</p>

<p>However, if we want to be able to create external libraries we need to create the variable:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/byor-r-and-p-pythonhome.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 9:</strong> <em>Create PYTHONHOME</em></p>

<p>In <em>Figure 9</em>, we see how I set the value of <code>PYTHONHOME</code> to where Python is installed. Having the variable makes it somewhat easier to set the required permissions we saw in <em>Code Snippet 6</em>, and <em>Code Snippet 7</em> as we can doe something like so: <code>icacls &quot;%PYTHONHOME%&quot; /grant ...</code>. We do not need to explicitly set the path.</p>

<p>There is a downside with <code>PYTHONHOME</code> where it can cause unexpected errors, and we look at that in the <a href="/2021/01/09/solve-python-issues-in-sql-server-machine-learning-services-after-deploying-python-3.9/"><strong>Solve Python Issues in SQL Server Machine Learning Services After Deploying Python 3.9</strong></a> post. That post led to the updates to this post.</p>

<p><strong>End Edit: <code>PYTHONHOME</code></strong></p>

<p>We are almost ready for a summary, but one last thing.</p>

<h4 id="python-extension-and-python-versions">Python Extension and Python Versions</h4>

<p>Cool, so above we&rsquo;ve seen how I can bring my own Python runtime, and in this case, it was 3.7.9. What about if I wanted a later version, let&rsquo;s say 3.9?</p>

<p>It so happens that I have Python 3.9.1 installed on my machine, so I:</p>

<ul>
<li><del>change <code>PYTHONHOME</code> to point to where 3.9 is.</del></li>
<li>ensure Python 3.9.1 is on the <code>PATH</code></li>
<li>apply the necessary permissions for the <em>Launchpad</em> service and <code>ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, when I execute the code as previous, I get the same error as in <em>Figure 7</em>. This is because the Python language extension is Python version-specific, and the release we use here is for Python 3.7.x. For other versions of Python (3.8, 3.9, etc.) you must modify and rebuild the Python Extension binaries. Look out for a future post around targeting different Python versions.</p>

<p>The R and Java extensions are not version specific.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>In this post, we discussed how Microsoft has open-sourced language extensions for R, Python and Java, which means we can bring our own R and Python runtimes. We mentioned how the language extensions are C++ dll&rsquo;s implementing the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/language-extensions/reference/extensibility-framework-api?view=sql-server-ver15">Extensibility Framework API for SQL Server</a>.</p>

<p>We looked at using a later version of Python, (3.7.9), than the Python version included in SQL Server Machine Learning Services. To use another version, after we have installed the version in question we:</p>

<ul>
<li>ensure that the Python version you want to is on the <code>PATH</code> on the SQL Server box.</li>
<li>download the Python language extension.</li>
<li>create a system environment variable <code>PYTHONHOME</code> pointing to the install directory of the version. Not necessary unless you want to create external libraries for your language.</li>
<li>assign read and write permissions to the SQL Server instance-specific <em>Launchpad</em> service, and the <code>ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES</code> group.</li>
<li>create an external language using the <code>CREATE EXTERNAL LANGUAGE</code> syntax, with a unique name, (we cannot name it Python/R).</li>
</ul>

<p>When we&rsquo;ve done the above, we can execute using <code>sp_execute_external_script</code>.</p>

<p>The Python differs from the R and Java extensions in that it is version-specific. The extension we have used here are tied to Python runtimes 3.7.x. For other Python version, we need to modify and rebuild.</p>

<p>Oh, and if you want to bring your own version of R, you do it in the same was we did here with Python.</p>
