      <description>&lt;p&gt;As many of you know, I am an un-ashamed .NET developer on the Windows platform. Seeing that I do a lot of SQL Server development my development and OS platforms of choice is sufficient for my work, as I on my development box (Windows of course) install SQL Server Developer edition and whatever .NET framework I use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That has been sufficient up until now when I want to develop against Kafka. At &lt;a href=&#34;/derivco&#34;&gt;Derivco&lt;/a&gt; we are getting more and more interested in Kafka, and obviously, I want to install it so I can &lt;del&gt;play around&lt;/del&gt; investigate it. However, to install it on my development machine as I would typically do with technologies I am interested in, SQL Server, RabbitMQ, etc., is difficult, if not impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes I know, there are articles on the web discussing how to run Kafka on Windows, but it is a hit and miss whether it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A while ago I wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;/2018/07/10/install-confluent-platform-kafka-on-windows/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about how to run Kafka under &lt;strong&gt;Windows Subsystem for Linux&lt;/strong&gt; (WSL), and yes it works, but I have had issues with it, and to me, it is still a hack. So the options then (if we rule out WSL) are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Running it on a Linux in a virtualized environment, (Virtual Box, VMWare, Hyper-V, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Docker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this post goes through how to set up the &lt;em&gt;Confluent Platform&lt;/em&gt; in a Docker environment and use it from .NET.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Install Confluent Platform (Kafka) on Windows</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You who follows my blog and have read my weekly roundups you know that I am quite (that is an understatement) interested in Apache Kafka and I am curious to find out what &amp;ldquo;cool&amp;rdquo; things one can do with it. For that, I want to be able to test &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo; quickly. When I test and try out new things, I usually do it on my development box which contains everything I need: &lt;strong&gt;SQL Server&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;RabbitMQ&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;RStudio&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Machine Learning Server&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Visual Studio&lt;/strong&gt; and the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So seeing that I have most of my &amp;ldquo;tools of the trade&amp;rdquo; on my machine I obviously also would like to have Kafka on the box. Herein lies a problem, I am a Windows dude and Kafka, and Windows do not gel. Yes, some people are running Kafka on Windows, but it is a chore. OK, so what to do? Sure, I could potentially run Kafka on a virtual machine, or in a Docker image, but it is not as transparent as I would like it to be (yeah, I am lazy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmm, Microsoft did introduce the ability to run Linux binary executables (in ELF format) natively on Windows 10 in Windows 10 version 1607. The feature is called &lt;strong&gt;Windows Subsystem for Linux&lt;/strong&gt; (WSL), and since I am now running version 1803, maybe I should try and install Kafka in &lt;em&gt;WSL&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
