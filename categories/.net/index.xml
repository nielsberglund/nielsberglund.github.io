      <description>&lt;p&gt;At PDC 2010 Microsoft showed the new &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/async.aspx&#34;&gt;Async&lt;/a&gt; features of coming C# (and VB.NET) versions, and quite a lot has been written about it already. Part of the Async CTP is &lt;strong&gt;TPL Dataflow&lt;/strong&gt;, and this has gone somewhat un-noticed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using F# in SQLCLR</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I have become very interested in F# and I am at the moment trying to get to grips with it. It is definitely a different beast than C#, but so far I like it - a lot!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I am a SQL nerd, and many moons ago I was very heavily involved in SQLCLR (for you who don&amp;rsquo;t know what that is; it is the ability to run .NET code inside the SQL Server engine. It was first introduced with SQL Server 2005). So I thought it would be a &amp;ldquo;giggle&amp;rdquo; to see if I could get some F# code running inside SQL Server.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>This post is more as a reminder to myself where to find online resources when learning F#. If anyone else can find it useful, so much better. And, if anyone out there has other online, resources, please leave a comment and I will include it. So, in no particular order:&#xA;Introductory article by Luke Hoban in MSDN Magazine. An online book about F#. Tutorial, by Dejan Jelovic, about getting started with F# from a C# developers perspective.</description>
