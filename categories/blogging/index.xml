      <title>Test Post and Feed Apologies</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&#34;/2018/08/18/goodbye-jekyll-welcome-hugo/&#34;&gt;Goodbye Jekyll, Welcome Hugo!&lt;/a&gt; post I wrote how I have changed blog engine from Jekyll to Hugo, and how everything seemed to work. Saying that obviously jinxed it, as after I deployed to the hosting site my Atom feed was completely hosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have now spent 4 hours trying to fix everything, but I am not sure I have succeeded. So this is a test post to see if things look OK.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in 2013 I wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;/2013/10/02/moving-to-a-new-blog-engine/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about how I moved from a self hosted &lt;strong&gt;WordPress&lt;/strong&gt; blog to a static blog; &lt;a href=&#34;http://octopress.org&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OctoPress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. OctoPress spoke to my &amp;ldquo;geeky&amp;rdquo; side, as the foundation of it is the static blog-generator &lt;a href=&#34;https://jekyllrb.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jekyll&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn is Ruby based. In fact, OctoPress is more or less just some extra Ruby plugins on top of Jekyll, and to generate sites with OctoPress / Ruby you need Ruby installed on you machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought that by changing the blog platform, I might write more posts just due to the &amp;ldquo;geekiness&amp;rdquo; of the blog engine. Fast forward to the end of 2016, and the number of posts I had written since the switch came to a grand total of three. Those three includes the post where I announced the switch. Yeah, switching increased indeed my productivity - NOT!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does this have to do with anything?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Testing, Testing, Anyone Out There?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What can I say, I am crap at this &amp;ldquo;blogging&amp;rdquo; thing! Three years ago, I &lt;a href=&#34;/2013/10/02/moving-to-a-new-blog-engine/&#34;&gt;resuscitated my blog&lt;/a&gt;, after a hiatus of one year. I also switched blog engine from WordPress to &lt;a href=&#34;http://octopress.org&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OctoPress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (which at that stage was version 2). At the time of the switch, I had had a one year hiatus of blogging (I am not a very prolific blog writer :)), and I remember I was very tempted to write in that &lt;a href=&#34;/2013/10/02/moving-to-a-new-blog-engine/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, that if I cannot keep up blogging I will quit. Boy, am I glad I did not write that!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Installing Octopress on Windows</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In an earlier &lt;a href=&#34;/2013/10/02/moving-to-a-new-blog-engine/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, I wrote how I had changed blog-engine from WordPress to &lt;a href=&#34;http://octopress.org/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OctoPress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. At the moment I am running Windows as my main OS (mostly due to work related requirements), and - as OctoPress is very much Ruby and Python based - there are certain things to be aware of when installing this on Windows. Furthermore, my blog is now hosted on &lt;strong&gt;Windows Azure&lt;/strong&gt; - so, with all this in mind, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d put together a blog post about the set-up of OctoPress on Windows, running on Windows Azure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Moving to a New Blog Engine</title>

      <description>Every so often I get an itch, and I want to try out a new blog-platform. The time has now come to leave my self-hosted WordPress and move on to something &amp;ldquo;geekier&amp;rdquo; (I am a geek after all).
I have just now finished moving my few posts from WordPress to the new engine: OctoPress. In a future blog post on the new blog I will try to explain why I made the move, and why OctoPress.</description>

      <description>As the saying goes; &amp;ldquo;It is hard to learn an old dog new tricks&amp;rdquo;, but&amp;hellip;Â Even though I am a really old dog, I hope I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to learn a bit about &amp;ldquo;social networking&amp;rdquo;, and therefore I created an account on Twitter a couple of days ago. Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to be more active on Twitter than what I&amp;rsquo;ve been here at the blog. Well, that should not be too hard, seeing how infrequent I post here.</description>
