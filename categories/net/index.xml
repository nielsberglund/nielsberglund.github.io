      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a while ago just finished watching the live stream of the first keynote (yes there will be one tomorrow as well), at Microsoft BUILD. Having attended / presented, at quite a few of these kind of events - and being somewhat jaded (well OK then, a lot jaded), I must still say that I am impressed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So yesterday &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://nielsberglund.com/post/2010-11-19-fsharp-mono-and-mac/&#34;&gt;I wrote&lt;/a&gt; about how I have started using F# and Mono on my MacBook.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wrote about how I downloaded the F# bits, unzipped and put them in a specific directory I had created. Today after having browsed around a bit more I realized I had done it the hard way. To install the required bits for F# for Mac, you only have to download a zip file with an install package for Mac from the &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://fsxplat.codeplex.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;F# Cross Platform&lt;/a&gt; site on CodePlex. The actual zip-file for the November 2010 CTP is &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://nielsberglund.com/post/2010-11-19-fsharp-mono-and-mac/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a first post about my experiences with running F# and Mono on a Mac.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://nielsberglund.com/post/2010-11-15-using-fsharp-in-sqlclr/&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about how I have started to play with F#. As that post also covered SQLCLR it was obvious I was on Windows. Even though I make my living from development in a Windows environment, my main machine is a MacBook, and I run OSX as my main OS. I have previously also been running Linux (ArchLinux) on this machine as my main OS. Naturally I have heard about Mono (and also installed it a couple of times - and quickly un-installed again, but I have not really done anything with it. I have always run Windows in a VM on my MacBook for development etc. However after the announcement that F# was going &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dsyme/archive/2010/11/04/announcing-the-f-compiler-library-source-code-drop.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Open Source&lt;/a&gt;, and &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://tomasp.net/blog&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tomas P&lt;/a&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-in-monodevelop.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; about his F# MonoDevelop plug-in&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;, I decided that I should have a look at what it would be like to do F# &amp;ldquo;stuff in OSX.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
