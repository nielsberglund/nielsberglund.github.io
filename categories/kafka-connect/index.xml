      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is the first of two looking at if and how we can stream data to Event Hubs from Debezium. Initially I had planned only one post covering this, but it turned out that the post would be too long, so therefore I split it in two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started with the post, &lt;a href=&#34;/2022/01/02/how-to-use-kafka-client-with-azure-event-hubs/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Use Kafka Client with Azure Event Hubs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In that post, I looked at how the Kafka client can publish messages to - not only - &lt;strong&gt;Apache Kafka&lt;/strong&gt; but also &lt;strong&gt;Azure Event Hubs&lt;/strong&gt;. In the post, I said something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An interesting point here is that it is not only your Kafka applications that can publish to Event Hubs but any application that uses Kafka Client 1.0+, like Kafka Connect connectors!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, for you who know me, I said that without having tested it properly, but: &lt;em&gt;how hard can it be? What could possibly go wrong?&lt;/em&gt;. Well, I was called upon it by a guy who had read the post. He told me he had tried what I said at one time or the other, and it hadn&amp;rsquo;t worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post (the first), we look at configuring Kafka Connect to connect to Event Hubs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
