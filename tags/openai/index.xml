      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this week&amp;rsquo;s blog post, we dive into some exciting developments in the tech world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we explore the Kusto Detective Academy, a valuable resource for mastering the Kusto Query Language (KQL) in Azure Data Explorer. Then, we discover GPT4Readability, a new tool powered by advanced language models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, designed to simplify the process of writing documentation and README files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we delve into the integration of Kafka, Debezium, and BentoML to build a machine-learning streaming pipeline and a preview of a stream processing performance report comparing Apache Flink with RisingWave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we get a glimpse into the upcoming Data Saturday Durban event and the intriguing topics under consideration. If you want to expand your knowledge and meet industry experts, don&amp;rsquo;t miss out on this exciting opportunity!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week, I came across debugging Jupyter notebooks in VSCode. I learned about some amazing applications of generative AI for analytics, content creation, and natural language queries. I also explored how to train a machine-learning model on a Kafka stream using Python libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://sessionize.com/data-saturday-durban2023/&#34;&gt;CfS&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;Data Saturday Durban 2023&lt;/strong&gt; is still open, and we have already received quite a few submissions. If you are interested in attending, I suggest you &lt;a href=&#34;https://datasaturdays.com/2023-08-19-datasaturday0043/&#34;&gt;book your seat&lt;/a&gt; NOW, as there are a limited number of seats for this &lt;strong&gt;FREE&lt;/strong&gt; event, and the event promises to be awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in these topics, read further, and you see the links to the articles and resources that inspired me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this week&amp;rsquo;s blog post, I share some interesting links and insights on generative AI for analytics, Microsoft Fabric, and real-time streaming. You will see links about using natural language queries to access data in Amazon RDS using OpenAI and LangChain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to leverage Microsoft Fabric to simplify and enhance your data solutions with Power BI and other Azure products and how to use Kusto Query Language and Kqlmagic in Fabric notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to compare and choose stream processing platforms for your use cases and detect and filter PII data from unstructured data streams using Confluent and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the full post for more details and examples.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A mixed bag this week: Azure Databricks and its Delta engine. In Azure Data Explorer &amp;ldquo;land&amp;rdquo; a combined Kusto Sink Connector and Kafka Connect image targeting multi-platform. Databricks has released MLflow 2.3 with new interesting features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Databricks; new functions in Databricks SQL allowing integration of large language models (LLMs) into SQL queries. Oh, and let&amp;rsquo;s not forget using Generative AI to create Synthetic Data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s exciting stuff: cool video from an &lt;strong&gt;Azure Data Explorer&lt;/strong&gt; (ADX) workshop. Speaking of ADX, I published my third post in the series of building a real-time leaderboard using Kafka and ADX. On the AI/ML side, &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo; about building a GPT-powered application and a really interesting intro to reinforcement learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a roundup without something about Kafka. So, a link to a post about Kafka and fraud detection. Also, a link to the second post in the series about machine learning and streaming data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not so much to cover this week. What you find in this post is a couple of links to posts about building customised chatbots based on GPT-4. There is also an interesting link to how to use Kafka and FastAPI to develop a realtime ticketing booking solution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Even though GPT-4 was just released I am quite proud that I am not linking to anything GPT-4 specific. ChatGPT and OpenAI, yes - but not GPT-4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what happened the week just gone? Some things to &amp;ldquo;wet your appetite&amp;rdquo;: learning path for &lt;strong&gt;Azure Data Explorer&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Kusto Query Language&lt;/strong&gt;. While we are on ADX, I finally finished the leaderboard follow-up post. Yay to me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some ChatGPT stuff (not GPT-4 ðŸ˜„), and also what impact AI will have on us as developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am rounding off with the question: &amp;ldquo;Where have all the Big Data Gone?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week it is mostly streaming related &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo; that has caught my eye. Regardless of that, we start with some Generative AI - or rather prompt engineering, where I link to a post around different types of &amp;ldquo;frameworks&amp;rdquo; for prompt engineering. When you read the post you will see why &amp;ldquo;frameworks&amp;rdquo; are in quotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From that we go into streaming &amp;ldquo;land&amp;rdquo; and look at stream processing vs. real-time OLAP databases. There&amp;rsquo;s an interesting article about building data lakes on AWS using open-source technologies. I round off the streaming with a post about Spark Structured Streaming and REST APIs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As opposed to last week with no Kafka related &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo;, this week there is a fair chunk. So, in this roundup you get a link to Linux containers on Apple Silicon. A deep dive into Microsoft LMOps, Mastodon, Kafka and OpenSearch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appear in this roundup with a link to the first post in a series about developing Leaderboards using Kafka and Azure Data Explorer. Oh, there is also something about running Kafka on Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading through this post, I realize that this is probably the first post where I have yet to mention Kafka; wow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this week, I link to posts about the new v2 Python programming model for Azure functions as well as &amp;ldquo;Tinder&amp;rdquo; for &lt;strong&gt;Azure Data Explorer&lt;/strong&gt;, a.k.a &amp;ldquo;Find a Partner&amp;rdquo;. Then there is quite a bit about OpenAI: use OpenAI in Synapse Analytics, a link to a post by John Gruber about the new Bing, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are you waiting for? Go ahead and read it ðŸ˜„.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This weeks roundup includes links to articles and videos about using Azure OpenAI and deploying ML models with FastAPI and Azure, as well as a post about Change Data Capture and its patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also discuss my experience with trying to run Flink SQL in Docker. In short, the Flink Docker experience could be better!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
