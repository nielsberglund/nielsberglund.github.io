      <description>&lt;p&gt;Week 41 has been an absolute whirlwind in both the AI agents space and my personal calendar, with major players releasing game-changing tools that promise to transform how we build, deploy, and optimise production-ready AI systems. OpenAI dropped AgentKit with its visual-first development stack. Stanford researchers unveiled AgentFlow&amp;rsquo;s clever reinforcement learning approach that makes 7B models punch above their weight. Anthropic launched a plugin system for Claude Code that finally solves the &amp;ldquo;how do I share my perfect setup&amp;rdquo; problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Jesse Vincent took things to a delightfully meta level with his Superpowers plugin, which uses psychological persuasion principles to make AI agents more reliable and disciplined, complete with Claude having an existential moment about its own programming. On the personal front, our &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://aimldatadurban.org/events/2025/ready-player-2/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data &amp;amp; AI Community Day Durban&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; event was a smashing success, with over 200 attendees and stellar ratings, thanks in large part to the fantastic team at &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.richfield.ac.za/campus/umhlanga/#&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richfield College Umhlanga&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who went above and beyond. Still, there&amp;rsquo;s no rest for the wicked as I&amp;rsquo;m now frantically prepping for another conference talk in &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dataandaicommunity.co.za/events/JHB-202510.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Johannesburg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this coming Saturday!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week brought some truly fascinating developments that signal we&amp;rsquo;re crossing major thresholds in AI and data architecture. From MIRIX&amp;rsquo;s revolutionary memory system, which enables AI agents to genuinely learn and evolve, to OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s ChatGPT Agent, marking the shift from conversational AI to actionable digital colleagues, we&amp;rsquo;re witnessing the emergence of AI as true collaborators rather than just sophisticated tools.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, developers like Kieran Klaassen are shipping faster than ever without writing a single line of code. At the same time, Google&amp;rsquo;s Richard Seroter argues that architectural thinking now matters more than implementation, suggesting the future belongs to those who can design intelligent systems rather than just build them. The common thread across all these developments is clear: we&amp;rsquo;re moving from AI as a tool to AI as a collaborator, and the winners will be those who master orchestration over implementation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s tech landscape reveals a fascinating convergence: while HTAP databases officially die and give way to modular data stacks, OpenAI proves that PostgreSQL mastery can handle ChatGPT&amp;rsquo;s massive scale with just one primary instance and dozens of replicas. Meanwhile, Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Code Researcher demonstrates AI agents evolving from simple code completion to autonomous system-level debugging. At the same time, OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s O3 family introduces true reasoning models that think through problems rather than relying on pattern matching.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The meta-narrative emerging is clear: traditional engineering excellence is converging with AI-native approaches, while organisational dynamics continue to trump pure technical merit in enterprise adoption. From self-evolving agents that develop strategic planning autonomously to comprehensive frameworks democratising AI development, we&amp;rsquo;re witnessing the early stages of Software 3.0&amp;rsquo;s promised transformation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Even though GPT-4 was just released I am quite proud that I am not linking to anything GPT-4 specific. ChatGPT and OpenAI, yes - but not GPT-4.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what happened the week just gone? Some things to &amp;ldquo;wet your appetite&amp;rdquo;: learning path for &lt;strong&gt;Azure Data Explorer&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Kusto Query Language&lt;/strong&gt;. While we are on ADX, I finally finished the leaderboard follow-up post. Yay to me!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some ChatGPT stuff (not GPT-4 &amp;#x1f604;), and also what impact AI will have on us as developers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am rounding off with the question: &amp;ldquo;Where have all the Big Data Gone?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week it is mostly streaming related &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo; that has caught my eye. Regardless of that, we start with some Generative AI - or rather prompt engineering, where I link to a post around different types of &amp;ldquo;frameworks&amp;rdquo; for prompt engineering. When you read the post you will see why &amp;ldquo;frameworks&amp;rdquo; are in quotes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From that we go into streaming &amp;ldquo;land&amp;rdquo; and look at stream processing vs. real-time OLAP databases. There&amp;rsquo;s an interesting article about building data lakes on AWS using open-source technologies. I round off the streaming with a post about Spark Structured Streaming and REST APIs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As opposed to last week with no Kafka related &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo;, this week there is a fair chunk. So, in this roundup you get a link to Linux containers on Apple Silicon. A deep dive into Microsoft LMOps, Mastodon, Kafka and OpenSearch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I appear in this roundup with a link to the first post in a series about developing Leaderboards using Kafka and Azure Data Explorer. Oh, there is also something about running Kafka on Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading through this post, I realize that this is probably the first post where I have yet to mention Kafka; wow!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So this week, I link to posts about the new v2 Python programming model for Azure functions as well as &amp;ldquo;Tinder&amp;rdquo; for &lt;strong&gt;Azure Data Explorer&lt;/strong&gt;, a.k.a &amp;ldquo;Find a Partner&amp;rdquo;. Then there is quite a bit about OpenAI: use OpenAI in Synapse Analytics, a link to a post by John Gruber about the new Bing, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what are you waiting for? Go ahead and read it &amp;#x1f604;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This weeks roundup includes links to articles and videos about using Azure OpenAI and deploying ML models with FastAPI and Azure, as well as a post about Change Data Capture and its patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also discuss my experience with trying to run Flink SQL in Docker. In short, the Flink Docker experience could be better!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
