      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s exciting stuff: cool video from an &lt;strong&gt;Azure Data Explorer&lt;/strong&gt; (ADX) workshop. Speaking of ADX, I published my third post in the series of building a real-time leaderboard using Kafka and ADX. On the AI/ML side, &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo; about building a GPT-powered application and a really interesting intro to reinforcement learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a roundup without something about Kafka. So, a link to a post about Kafka and fraud detection. Also, a link to the second post in the series about machine learning and streaming data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not so much to cover this week. What you find in this post is a couple of links to posts about building customised chatbots based on GPT-4. There is also an interesting link to how to use Kafka and FastAPI to develop a realtime ticketing booking solution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Even though GPT-4 was just released I am quite proud that I am not linking to anything GPT-4 specific. ChatGPT and OpenAI, yes - but not GPT-4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what happened the week just gone? Some things to &amp;ldquo;wet your appetite&amp;rdquo;: learning path for &lt;strong&gt;Azure Data Explorer&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Kusto Query Language&lt;/strong&gt;. While we are on ADX, I finally finished the leaderboard follow-up post. Yay to me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some ChatGPT stuff (not GPT-4 ðŸ˜„), and also what impact AI will have on us as developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am rounding off with the question: &amp;ldquo;Where have all the Big Data Gone?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week it is mostly streaming related &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo; that has caught my eye. Regardless of that, we start with some Generative AI - or rather prompt engineering, where I link to a post around different types of &amp;ldquo;frameworks&amp;rdquo; for prompt engineering. When you read the post you will see why &amp;ldquo;frameworks&amp;rdquo; are in quotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From that we go into streaming &amp;ldquo;land&amp;rdquo; and look at stream processing vs. real-time OLAP databases. There&amp;rsquo;s an interesting article about building data lakes on AWS using open-source technologies. I round off the streaming with a post about Spark Structured Streaming and REST APIs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As opposed to last week with no Kafka related &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo;, this week there is a fair chunk. So, in this roundup you get a link to Linux containers on Apple Silicon. A deep dive into Microsoft LMOps, Mastodon, Kafka and OpenSearch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appear in this roundup with a link to the first post in a series about developing Leaderboards using Kafka and Azure Data Explorer. Oh, there is also something about running Kafka on Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading through this post, I realize that this is probably the first post where I have yet to mention Kafka; wow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this week, I link to posts about the new v2 Python programming model for Azure functions as well as &amp;ldquo;Tinder&amp;rdquo; for &lt;strong&gt;Azure Data Explorer&lt;/strong&gt;, a.k.a &amp;ldquo;Find a Partner&amp;rdquo;. Then there is quite a bit about OpenAI: use OpenAI in Synapse Analytics, a link to a post by John Gruber about the new Bing, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are you waiting for? Go ahead and read it ðŸ˜„.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This weeks roundup includes links to articles and videos about using Azure OpenAI and deploying ML models with FastAPI and Azure, as well as a post about Change Data Capture and its patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also discuss my experience with trying to run Flink SQL in Docker. In short, the Flink Docker experience could be better!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
