      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post came about due to a question on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=MicrosoftR&#34;&gt;Microsoft Machine Learning Server&lt;/a&gt; forum. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/70e3577c-58f1-40af-9f0b-546c8b181cfa/sql-server-r-services-are-more-input-datasets-planned-or-under-development?forum=MicrosoftR&#34;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; was if there are any plans by Microsoft to support more the one input dataset (&lt;code&gt;@input_data_1&lt;/code&gt;) in &lt;code&gt;sp_execute_external_script&lt;/code&gt;. My immediate reaction was that if you want more than one dataset, you can always connect from the script back into the database, and retrieve data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the poster was well aware of that, but due to certain reasons he did not want to do it that way - he wanted to push in the data, fair enough. When I read this, I seemed to remember something from a while ago, where, instead of retrieving data from inside the script, they pushed in the data, serialized it as an output parameter and then used the binary representation as in input parameter (yeah - this sounds confusing, but bear with me). I did some research (read Googling), and found &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42918990/how-to-pass-two-sql-tables-as-input-parameter-for-r-codes-in-sql-server&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; StackOverflow question, and answer. So for future questions, and for me to remember, I decided to write a blog post about it.&lt;/p&gt;
