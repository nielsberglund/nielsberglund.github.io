      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s roundup explores the critical shift from vague AI assistants to specialised, instruction-driven agents that actually deliver value, covering everything from GitHub Copilot&amp;rsquo;s instruction file architecture to sophisticated memory systems that transform digital amnesia into persistent Intelligence. We dive deep into Apache Iceberg&amp;rsquo;s emergence as the open table format of choice for unified real-time and batch analytics, examining why the appealing &amp;ldquo;Zero Copy&amp;rdquo; dream of streaming Kafka topics directly into lakehouse tables often backfires in production.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Generative AI section examines Google&amp;rsquo;s competitive panic mode as Gemini 3.0 Pro accelerates toward release, reveals how proper memory architectures enable AI agents to learn and adapt across sessions, and dissects why effective agents need operating manuals rather than mission statements. Plus, I share updates from .NET Conf Cape Town and details about our final &lt;strong&gt;Data &amp;amp; AI Community Day Durban&lt;/strong&gt; event of 2025, complete with a holiday-themed MCP deep-dive that&amp;rsquo;s opening registrations today (grab your tickets before they disappear faster than free pizza at a developer meetup!).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s roundup explores the foundational research papers that transformed AI from an academic curiosity into production-ready technology, covering everything from the revolutionary Transformer architecture to the Model Context Protocol, which enables standardised tool integration. We examine critical performance optimisation techniques for Azure OpenAI deployments, where asynchronous programming delivers 11x speed improvements by parallelising tasks instead of processing them sequentially.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The spotlight then shifts to a paradigm-challenging analysis of why small language models with fewer than 10 billion parameters are proving architecturally superior for agentic AI systems, potentially delivering 30 times the cost savings while matching the performance of their trillion-parameter cousins on specialised tasks. Finally, I share updates from the successful .NET Conf 2025 Durban event and preview the upcoming roadshow, which will visit Cape Town and Johannesburg, where I&amp;rsquo;ll explore Model Context Protocol integration with C# and Azure AI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s roundup tackles the critical infrastructure challenges emerging as AI agents reshape software development, from Claude Code&amp;rsquo;s advanced orchestration strategies and the hidden costs of 10x coding velocity to Anthropic&amp;rsquo;s breakthrough 98% token reduction through code execution with MCP. Microsoft Research&amp;rsquo;s Magentic Marketplace simulation exposes troubling vulnerabilities in agentic markets, revealing that even state-of-the-art models struggle with the &amp;ldquo;Paradox of Choice&amp;rdquo; and manipulation resistance when operating at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I&amp;rsquo;m deep in prep mode for &lt;strong&gt;Durban&amp;rsquo;s first-ever .NET Conf on November 15&lt;/strong&gt; at Richfield College Umhlanga Campus, a milestone event proving our city can host world-class developer conferences, while simultaneously planning &lt;strong&gt;December 13&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Data &amp;amp; AI Community Day Durban: Season of AI - Merry Christmas People (MCP)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;, where we&amp;rsquo;ll unwrap the latest in Model Context Protocol and agentic AI development with festive flair. The convergence of production-ready AI coding tools and the need for radically rethought development infrastructure has never been more apparent, and this week&amp;rsquo;s posts chart the path forward with unusual clarity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Week 43, 2025! This week&amp;rsquo;s roundup explores the cutting edge of AI-assisted development and streaming infrastructure, from Anthropic&amp;rsquo;s Claude Code for web revolutionising autonomous coding with smart sandboxing, to GitHub&amp;rsquo;s new MCP Registry bringing order to the AI tooling chaos.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We also dive into Netflix&amp;rsquo;s engineering marvel that delivers real-time recommendations to over 100 million devices without melting their infrastructure. Plus, I&amp;rsquo;m excited to share my personal news: I&amp;rsquo;ve submitted talks to all three .NET Conf 2025 South Africa events, including the historic first-ever .NET Conf in Durban. The Call for Speakers is still open if you want to be part of this milestone moment for our developer community!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Week 42 delivers a masterclass in engineering honesty and AI accessibility that cuts through the usual tech hype. Netflix&amp;rsquo;s Adrian Taruc and James Dalton reveal how they built a Real-Time Distributed Graph processing system capable of handling 5 million records per second, candidly admitting their initial monolithic Flink job was an &amp;ldquo;operational headache&amp;rdquo; before pivoting to a more complex but maintainable architecture. Andrej Karpathy proves AI training doesn&amp;rsquo;t require enterprise budgets with nanochat. Training a GPT-2-calibre model in under four hours for approximately $92. GitHub&amp;rsquo;s Andrea Griffiths tackles the COBOL crisis, showing how AI agents can modernise 65-year-old mainframe systems without developers learning COBOL. Anthropic dominates with Claude Haiku 4.5 (frontier performance at one-third the cost) and Agent Skills, an elegantly simple filesystem-based approach to agent specialisation that treats domain expertise like employee onboarding through progressive disclosure and structured folders.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I found myself in Johannesburg delivering &lt;strong&gt;Generative AI for Beginners: Build Your First Agent with Azure AI Foundry&lt;/strong&gt; at the Data &amp;amp; AI Community Day event to an almost-full house. There&amp;rsquo;s no rest ahead, though, for the first time ever, &lt;strong&gt;.NET Conf South Africa Community Edition&lt;/strong&gt; is coming to Durban on November 15 at &lt;strong&gt;Richfield College&lt;/strong&gt;, and we&amp;rsquo;re actively seeking speakers with .NET, C#, Blazor, MAUI, ASP.NET Core, or Azure expertise to share with the KwaZulu-Natal developer community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Interesting Stuff - Week 35, 2025</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Week 35 brings a fascinating paradox in AI development: while Anthropic pilots Claude for Chrome with impressive capabilities but sobering security vulnerabilities, researchers discover that the most human-sounding AI model costs just pennies compared to premium alternatives. From Claude Code&amp;rsquo;s meteoric rise among developers to Google&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;nano-banana&amp;rdquo; image generation model, this week highlights how the AI landscape is being shaped as much by user experience design and cost-effectiveness as raw technical performance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The developments span from browser automation and coding assistants to image generation and market research, revealing an industry where authenticity and accessibility often trump expensive computational power. On the local front, after years without a dedicated .NET conference in Durban due to venue constraints, &lt;strong&gt;.NET Conf SA&lt;/strong&gt; is tentatively scheduled for November 15 at the Umhlanga Campus of &lt;strong&gt;Richfield College&lt;/strong&gt;, marking a significant milestone for the regional developer community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
