      <description>&lt;p&gt;For readers of my blog, it should not come as a surprise that I think Apache Kafka is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/the%20best%2Fgreatest%20thing%20since%20sliced%20bread&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;the greatest thing since sliced bread&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, and I have written &lt;a href=&#34;https://nielsberglund.com/categories/kafka/&#34;&gt;some posts&lt;/a&gt; about it. The posts I have written has been geared towards the setup/deployment of Kafka, with a Windows/.NET slant to it. This post is in the same vein; how to set up Kafka but in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;conference season&amp;rdquo; is upon us, and I have some conference talks coming up. This year quite a lot of what I am talking about is in the cloud, specifically Azure. As some of the talks involve Apache Kafka, I thought it would be good if Kafka also ran in the cloud. Sure, I could always run Kafka on Docker on a VM in the cloud, but &amp;ldquo;they&amp;rdquo; say serverless is the new &amp;ldquo;in&amp;rdquo; thing, as well as managed services, so why not try that out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this post is about how to deploy Confluent Cloud on Azure!&lt;/p&gt;
