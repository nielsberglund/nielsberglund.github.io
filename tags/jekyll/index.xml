      <title>Test Post and Feed Apologies</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&#34;/2018/08/18/goodbye-jekyll-welcome-hugo/&#34;&gt;Goodbye Jekyll, Welcome Hugo!&lt;/a&gt; post I wrote how I have changed blog engine from Jekyll to Hugo, and how everything seemed to work. Saying that obviously jinxed it, as after I deployed to the hosting site my Atom feed was completely hosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have now spent 4 hours trying to fix everything, but I am not sure I have succeeded. So this is a test post to see if things look OK.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in 2013 I wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;/2013/10/02/moving-to-a-new-blog-engine/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about how I moved from a self hosted &lt;strong&gt;WordPress&lt;/strong&gt; blog to a static blog; &lt;a href=&#34;http://octopress.org&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OctoPress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. OctoPress spoke to my &amp;ldquo;geeky&amp;rdquo; side, as the foundation of it is the static blog-generator &lt;a href=&#34;https://jekyllrb.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jekyll&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn is Ruby based. In fact, OctoPress is more or less just some extra Ruby plugins on top of Jekyll, and to generate sites with OctoPress / Ruby you need Ruby installed on you machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought that by changing the blog platform, I might write more posts just due to the &amp;ldquo;geekiness&amp;rdquo; of the blog engine. Fast forward to the end of 2016, and the number of posts I had written since the switch came to a grand total of three. Those three includes the post where I announced the switch. Yeah, switching increased indeed my productivity - NOT!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does this have to do with anything?&lt;/p&gt;
