      <description>So yesterday I wrote about how I have started using F# and Mono on my MacBook.
I wrote about how I downloaded the F# bits, unzipped and put them in a specific directory I had created. Today after having browsed around a bit more I realized I had done it the hard way. To install the required bits for F# for Mac, you only have to download a zip file with an install package for Mac from the F# Cross Platform site on CodePlex.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a first post about my experiences with running F# and Mono on a Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&#34;/2010/11/15/using-f#-in-sqlclr/&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about how I have started to play with F#. As that post also covered SQLCLR it was obvious I was on Windows. Even though I make my living from development in a Windows environment, my main machine is a MacBook, and I run OSX as my main OS. I have previously also been running Linux (ArchLinux) on this machine as my main OS. Naturally I have heard about Mono (and also installed it a couple of times - and quickly un-installed again, but I have not really done anything with it. I have always run Windows in a VM on my MacBook for development etc. However after the announcement that F# was going &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dsyme/archive/2010/11/04/announcing-the-f-compiler-library-source-code-drop.aspx&#34;&gt;Open Source&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://tomasp.net/blog&#34;&gt;Tomas P&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-in-monodevelop.aspx&#34;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; about his F# MonoDevelop plug-in&lt;/a&gt;, I decided that I should have a look at what it would be like to do F# &amp;ldquo;stuff in OSX.&lt;/p&gt;
