      <description>&lt;p&gt;A little while ago I wrote a blog post, &lt;a href=&#34;/2019/05/26/java--sql-server-2019-extensibility-framework-the-sequel/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Java &amp;amp; SQL Server 2019 Extensibility Framework: The Sequel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, about changes in SQL Server 2019 CTP 2.5 impacting how we write Java code for use from SQL Server. While I wrote that post, Microsoft released SQL Server 2019 CTP 3.0, and, (surprise, surprise), that release contains more changes affecting Java code in SQL Server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post covers those changes as well as discusses what SQL Server Extensibility Framework and Language Extensions are.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As you may know, a while back I wrote some posts about the support for Java in SQL Server 2019: &lt;a href=&#34;/s2k19_ext_framework_java&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SQL Server 2019 Extensibility Framework &amp;amp; Java&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The posts covered in some detail how Java in SQL Server worked, and how to write Java code for use in SQL Server. However, a week or two ago &amp;ldquo;the sky came tumbling down&amp;rdquo; when Microsoft released SQL Server 2019 CTP 2.5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; CTP stands for Community Technology Preview and is like a beta release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Microsoft did in CTP 2.5 was to introduce Java Language Extension SDK, and your Java code now needs to inherit an abstract base class from the SDK. This requirement makes a large part of my previous posts &amp;ldquo;null and void&amp;rdquo;, so in this post, we look at what to do going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Installing R Packages in SQL Server Machine Learning Services - IV: Permissions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is the fourth in a series about installing R packages in &lt;strong&gt;SQL Server Machine Learning Services&lt;/strong&gt; (SQL Server ML Services). To see all posts in the series go to &lt;a href=&#34;/sql_server_ml_services_install_packages&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Install R Packages in SQL Server ML Services Series&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why this series came about is a colleague of mine &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/dane-bax/&#34;&gt;Dane&lt;/a&gt; pinged me and asked if I had any advice as he had issues installing an R package into one of their SQL Server instances. I tried to help him and then thought it would make a good topic for a blog post. Of course, at that time I didn&amp;rsquo;t think it would be more posts than one, but here we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, we look at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What permissions &lt;code&gt;CREATE EXTERNAL LIBRARY&lt;/code&gt; requires.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to create external libraries with different owners and what impact it has.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is part of the &lt;a href=&#34;/s2k19_ext_framework_java&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SQL Server 2019 Extensibility Framework &amp;amp; Java&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; series of posts, and it is the second post discussing SQL Server 2019, Java and the creation and use of external libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the previous post about external libraries, we said that they were beneficial as they reduced complexities when deploying code, but there were still some caveats. So, in this post, we look at how to overcome those caveats&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth, that has to do with things that interest me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;data science&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;data in general&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;distributed computing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SQL Server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;transactions (both db as well as non db)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and other &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog-post is the &amp;ldquo;roundup&amp;rdquo; of the things that have been most interesting to me, for the week just ending.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SQL Server 2019, Java &amp; External Libraries - I</title>
      <link>/2019/03/10/sql-server-2019-java--external-libraries---i/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago I wrote a series of posts about one of the new features in SQL Server 2019; the ability to call out to Java code from inside SQL Server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see the posts, go to &lt;a href=&#34;/s2k19_ext_framework_java&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SQL Server 2019 Extensibility Framework &amp;amp; Java&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the posts, we discussed how the Java extension differs from R and Python in that R and Python are an integrated part of the SQL Server install (when enabling in-database analytics), but Java is not. In other words, the use of the Java extension requires Java to be installed beforehand, and this then has implications on permissions. We also discussed how Java is a compiled language, and we execute against a method in a class, whereas with R and Python we send a script to the external engine. The consequence of this is that when we execute Java code, we need to indicate where the compiled code resides, and those locations need specific permissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this creates a level of complexity, and it would potentially be easier if we load the Java code from a well-known place, where we do not need to worry about permissions and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is the first of a couple where we see how new functionality in SQL Server 2019 CTP 2.3 can help.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SQL Server 2019 &amp; Java with Visual Studio Code</title>
      <link>/2019/01/17/sql-server-2019--java-with-visual-studio-code/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As you know, SQL Server 2019 introduces the Java language extensions as part of the &lt;strong&gt;SQL Server Extensibility Framework&lt;/strong&gt;. The Java language extensions make it possible to execute Java code from inside SQL Server, the same way we can run R/Python code. Seeing that I am &amp;ldquo;somewhat&amp;rdquo; interested in the &lt;strong&gt;SQL Server Extensibility Framework&lt;/strong&gt; I wrote some posts about the Java language extensions: &lt;a href=&#34;/s2k19_ext_framework_java&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SQL Server 2019 Extensibility Framework &amp;amp; Java&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code in the posts is very, very simplistic where I was just trying to get the ideas across how and what to do. Another reason the code is simplistic is that I am not a Java &amp;ldquo;person&amp;rdquo;; in fact, the only Java code I have ever written is what is in those posts. Me not being a Java &amp;ldquo;person&amp;rdquo; I do not have a Java IDE, (for the code I wrote I did not need one either), so I used my regular text editor &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sublimetext.com/&#34;&gt;Sublime Text 3&lt;/a&gt;, and I compiled the code from command line (&lt;code&gt;$ javac ...&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then started on a new Java post (which I have not finished yet), and it became clear I needed an IDE, (intelli-sense, debug, etc.), but which IDE?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is the fourth post in a series where I look at the Java extension in SQL Server, i.e. the ability to execute Java code from inside SQL Server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see what other posts there are in the series, go to &lt;a href=&#34;/s2k19_ext_framework_java&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SQL Server 2019 Extensibility Framework &amp;amp; Java&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fourth post acts as a &amp;ldquo;roundup&amp;rdquo; of miscellaneous &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo; I did not cover in the three previous posts, and some of the things we look at are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Java packages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;CLASSPATH&lt;/code&gt; environment variable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JAR files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, let us get into it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SQL Server ML Services - Multiple Input Data Sets</title>
      <link>/2018/12/24/sql-server-ml-services---multiple-input-data-sets/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 24 Dec 2018 06:51:12 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2018/12/24/sql-server-ml-services---multiple-input-data-sets/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post came about due to a question on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=MicrosoftR&#34;&gt;Microsoft Machine Learning Server&lt;/a&gt; forum. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/70e3577c-58f1-40af-9f0b-546c8b181cfa/sql-server-r-services-are-more-input-datasets-planned-or-under-development?forum=MicrosoftR&#34;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; was if there are any plans by Microsoft to support more the one input dataset (&lt;code&gt;@input_data_1&lt;/code&gt;) in &lt;code&gt;sp_execute_external_script&lt;/code&gt;. My immediate reaction was that if you want more than one dataset, you can always connect from the script back into the database, and retrieve data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the poster was well aware of that, but due to certain reasons he did not want to do it that way - he wanted to push in the data, fair enough. When I read this, I seemed to remember something from a while ago, where, instead of retrieving data from inside the script, they pushed in the data, serialized it as an output parameter and then used the binary representation as in input parameter (yeah - this sounds confusing, but bear with me). I did some research (read Googling), and found &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42918990/how-to-pass-two-sql-tables-as-input-parameter-for-r-codes-in-sql-server&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; StackOverflow question, and answer. So for future questions, and for me to remember, I decided to write a blog post about it.&lt;/p&gt;
