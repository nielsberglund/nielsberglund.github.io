      <description>&lt;p&gt;.. from a relational developers perspective!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, the title may be a bit harsh, but at least it grabbed your attention - did it not?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week ago, or so, I wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;/2010/11/07/what-new-programmability-features-will-there-be-in-sql-11/&#34;&gt;wish list&lt;/a&gt; to Santa for Denali from a relational developers perspective. In that wish list I wrote that there has been fairly little love for relational SQL developers in the recent versions of SQL Server, and that I hoped in this version (i.e Denali) Microsoft would &amp;ldquo;go back to the roots&amp;rdquo; and give us developers some new stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my previous &lt;a href=&#34;/2010/11/10/new-t-sql-features-in-sql-11-/-denali---error-handling/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about the new &lt;code&gt;THROW&lt;/code&gt; keyword in Denali / SQL 11. Having played around a bit more with Denali, I wanted to write some additional things about &lt;code&gt;THROW&lt;/code&gt; and it&amp;rsquo;s relation to &lt;code&gt;RAISERROR&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago I wrote my &lt;a href=&#34;/2010/11/07/what-new-programmability-features-will-there-be-in-sql-11/&#34;&gt;wish-list&lt;/a&gt; to Santa what I wanted to see in next version of SQL Server (SQL 11 / Denali). I was pleasantly surprised that I could find out for myself shortly after; i.e. SQL Server Denali CTP1 was released during the PASS Summit. I have literally finished installing the next version of SQL Server (Denali / SQL 11) on a new VM, like 10 minutes ago, and I have done a quick check of the new features of SQL Server Denali (what I could find at least) against my &lt;a href=&#34;/2010/11/07/what-new-programmability-features-will-there-be-in-sql-11/&#34;&gt;wish-list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>So yesterday I posted my wish-list for new programmability features in the upcoming release of SQL 11 / Denali.
Today I see that Simon S has posted about a new series of posts he will do, covering what is new in SQL 11. Knowing Simon, it will be really, really good. So if you are interested I suggest you keep your eyes open for his posts.
UPDATE: Ben C commented and said that CTP1 has been released (or something to that effect), and here is where it can be downloaded from.</description>

      <title>What New Programmability Features Will There Be in SQL 11?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is probably no secret that Microsoft is working hard on next version of SQL Server. The rumour has it that it will be named SQL 11 (it apparently goes under the code name of Denali. Quiz; MS has used the Denali code name previously, what was it for? Answers in the comments ).&lt;/p&gt;
