      <description>&lt;p&gt;A while ago, I wanted to do a quick test on a new SQL installation, and I wanted the SQL installation to be on a &amp;ldquo;pristine&amp;rdquo; server. I was not keen on creating a new virtual machine on my local dev-box, as for that I would need to create a VM image etc., and it seemed like too much hassle for a lazy person like me. The obvious choice then is to do it in the cloud. How hard can that be, what could possibly go wrong?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turned out to not be as straight-forward as I thought it would be, but eventually, I managed to get it right.
