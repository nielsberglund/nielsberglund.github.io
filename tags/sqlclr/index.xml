      <title>SQL Server 2017 SQLCLR - Whitelisting Assemblies</title>
      <link>https://nielsberglund.com/post/2017-07-23-sql-server-2017-sqlclr-white-listing-assemblies/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A little while ago I wrote a 

&lt;a href=&#34;https://nielsberglund.com/post/2017-07-02-sql-server-2017-sqlclr-and-permissions/&#34;&gt;blog-post&lt;/a&gt; about the changes in the SQLCLR security model in SQL Server 2017. I wrote about how Microsoft has changed the relation between CAS and security boundaries, and CAS is no longer supported as a boundary! And also how Microsoft introduced an &lt;code&gt;sp_configure&lt;/code&gt; option called &lt;code&gt;clr strict security&lt;/code&gt;, which by default is set to 1 (on). When the setting is on, SQL Server treats all assemblies (&lt;code&gt;SAFE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;EXTERNAL_ACCESS&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;UNSAFE&lt;/code&gt;) as if they were marked &lt;code&gt;UNSAFE&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release I wrote the post against was CTP 2.1, and earlier this week Microsoft released SQL Server 2017 RC1. Some days ago I received a comment from &lt;em&gt;Paul Vestuto&lt;/em&gt; on my 

&lt;a href=&#34;https://nielsberglund.com/post/2017-07-02-sql-server-2017-sqlclr-and-permissions/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, pointing out that in RC1 there has been some more changes to the security model. I thought those changes would earn their own blog-post, instead of just editing the 

&lt;a href=&#34;https://nielsberglund.com/post/2017-07-02-sql-server-2017-sqlclr-and-permissions/&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SQL Server 2017, SQLCLR and Permissions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While I was writing the post about 

&lt;a href=&#34;https://nielsberglund.com/post/2017-07-01-sqlclr--certificates/&#34;&gt;SQLCLR and Certificates&lt;/a&gt;, I came across some strange behavior when I accidentally ran my code on an SQL Server 2017 instance. I quickly connected back to my SQL Server 2016 instance and continued. However, afterwards I started to look into the differences between SQLCLR in SQL Server 2017 and SQL Server 2016, and this post is the result of me &lt;del&gt;playing around&lt;/del&gt; investigating the changes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post originates, like the one about 

&lt;a href=&#34;https://nielsberglund.com/post/2017-06-25-creating-r-stored-procedures-in-sql-server-2016-using-sqlrutils/&#34;&gt;sqlrutils&lt;/a&gt;, from a question on a Microsoft forum - this time the 

&lt;a href=&#34;https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/sqlserver/en-US/home?forum=sqlnetfx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;.NET Framework inside SQL Server&lt;/a&gt; forum. As the name implies, the forum cover questions about the usage of SQLCLR (.NET inside SQL Server), and the 

&lt;a href=&#34;https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/sqlserver/en-US/35b8bce5-8ea9-4fd4-aa87-1764a2071e92/long-lasting-pfx-file-for-sqlclr-externalaccess-signing?forum=sqlnetfx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; was about signing of SQLCLR assemblies in order to assigning other permission sets than &lt;code&gt;SAFE&lt;/code&gt; to the assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I, back in the day, taught SQLCLR as part of Developmentor&amp;rsquo;s SQL Server curriculum, I thought that it&amp;rsquo;d be interesting if I tried to answer the question, and also make a blog-post about it. That way I&amp;rsquo;d remember what to do the next time the question came up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; In another post, I wrote this about Developmentor: &lt;em&gt;Developmentor were back in the day THE training company to go to if you wanted highly, highly technical training about COM, .NET, SQL Server, etc. 

&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.javaworld.com/article/2073792/core-java/a-eulogy--developmentor--rip.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; by my old colleague 

&lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.tedneward.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ted Neward&lt;/a&gt; (@tedneward) sums DM up quite accurately (apart from the fact that DM hadn&amp;rsquo;t closed its doors when the article was written, ooops).&lt;/em&gt; Ted was probably more accurate than he at the time thought, since DM went out of business somewhat later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, let&amp;rsquo;s see what this is all about&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As some of you may know, I - once upon a time - developed a project (VS add-in, templates, etc) for automatic deployment of CLR assemblies to SQL Server: &lt;strong&gt;SqlClrProject&lt;/strong&gt;. That project has been dormant now for a couple of years, but I now and then get requests for where it can be downloaded from (I had it on CodePlex, but had to take it down as I didn&amp;rsquo;t publish the source code).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using F# in SQLCLR</title>
      <link>https://nielsberglund.com/post/2010-11-15-using-fsharp-in-sqlclr/</link>

      <guid>https://nielsberglund.com/post/2010-11-15-using-fsharp-in-sqlclr/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I have become very interested in F# and I am at the moment trying to get to grips with it. It is definitely a different beast than C#, but so far I like it - a lot!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I am a SQL nerd, and many moons ago I was very heavily involved in SQLCLR (for you who don&amp;rsquo;t know what that is; it is the ability to run .NET code inside the SQL Server engine. It was first introduced with SQL Server 2005). So I thought it would be a &amp;ldquo;giggle&amp;rdquo; to see if I could get some F# code running inside SQL Server.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;.. from a relational developers perspective!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the title may be a bit harsh, but at least it grabbed your attention - did it not?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week ago, or so, I wrote a 

&lt;a href=&#34;https://nielsberglund.com/post/2010-11-07-what-new-programmability-features-will-there-be-in-sql-11/&#34;&gt;wish list&lt;/a&gt; to Santa for Denali from a relational developers perspective. In that wish list I wrote that there has been fairly little love for relational SQL developers in the recent versions of SQL Server, and that I hoped in this version (i.e Denali) Microsoft would &amp;ldquo;go back to the roots&amp;rdquo; and give us developers some new stuff.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is probably no secret that Microsoft is working hard on next version of SQL Server. The rumour has it that it will be named SQL 11 (it apparently goes under the code name of Denali. Quiz; MS has used the Denali code name previously, what was it for? Answers in the comments ).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
