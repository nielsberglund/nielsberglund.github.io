      <description>&lt;p&gt;Week 44, 2025, delivers a powerhouse lineup focused squarely on the evolving infrastructure of AI agents, from training to deployment, and everything in between. Microsoft Research&amp;rsquo;s Agent Lightning dominates the conversation with multiple deep dives exploring how reinforcement learning can finally make agents that actually learn from experience. At the same time, GitHub&amp;rsquo;s Agent HQ announcement promises to transform the platform into a unified orchestration layer for agents from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The week also brings critical perspectives on the scalability challenges of spec-driven development and two exceptional technical breakdowns of Claude&amp;rsquo;s Skills system; one exploring practical Neo4j integration and another delivering what might be the definitive reverse-engineered documentation of Skills&amp;rsquo; meta-tool architecture. Suppose you&amp;rsquo;re building with agents or trying to understand where this ecosystem is heading. In that case, this week&amp;rsquo;s roundup captures the exact moment when agent frameworks are maturing from experimental toys into production-ready infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
