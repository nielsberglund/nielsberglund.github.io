      <title>Cross-Platform Compatibility Made Easy with Multi-Platform Docker Images: Azure Data Explorer Sink Connector &amp; Kafka Connect</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As you may know, I am working on a blog-post series, &lt;strong&gt;Develop a Real-Time Leaderboard Using Kafka and Azure Data Explorer&lt;/strong&gt;. As the title implies, Kafka ingests data into &lt;strong&gt;Azure Data Explorer&lt;/strong&gt; (ADX). This is done using the Azure Data Explorer Kusto Sink connector, where the connector runs in a JVM process in Kafka Connect. All this run in Docker containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While writing (still writing) the fourth post in the series, I realised I had to create my own image for Kafka Connect and the Kusto Sink connector. You will find an explanation as to why below. Since I have partly gone over to the &amp;ldquo;dark side&amp;rdquo; (using Apple Silicon, ARM64), I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be nice if the image I created targeted both AMD64 and ARM64. I.e. I wanted to create a multi-platform image. In my usual style, I thought: &amp;ldquo;How hard can it be? What could possibly go wrong&amp;rdquo; ðŸ˜„.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it was a tad more difficult than I imagined, and in this post, I cover the steps I took to create my Kafka Connect and Kusto Sink connector image as a multi-platform Docker image. Oh, and if you are not interested in the Kusto Sink connector and Kafka Connect at all (you should be ðŸ˜„), don&amp;rsquo;t worry. The steps covered here work for any Docker Image you want to create as a multi-platform image.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Run Self-Managed Kusto Kafka Connector Serverless in Azure Container Instances</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, I 

&lt;a href=&#34;https://nielsberglund.com/post/2021-08-14-run-confluent-cloud--serverless-apache-kafka-on-azure/&#34;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; how I set up Kafka to run serverless in Azure by deploying Confluent Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have followed my blog lately, you have probably seen that I am interested in &lt;strong&gt;Azure Data Explorer&lt;/strong&gt; and that I have a couple of conference talks coming. One being:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to do Real-Time Analytics Using Apache Kafka and Azure Data Explorer&lt;/strong&gt;: We are looking at how to stream events from Apache Kafka to Azure Data Explorer (ADX) and perform user-facing analytics in near real-time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is how to connect Kafka with ADX? You normally connect Kafka with another system using a Kafka Connect connector, and fortunately a connector exists for connecting Kafka with ADX: the 

&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Azure/kafka-sink-azure-kusto&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kafka Connect Kusto Sink Connector&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, since I am running managed Kafka (Confluent Cloud, remember), I need a managed connector to run it in Confluent Cloud&amp;rsquo;s Kafka Connect. In the previous paragraph, I mentioned I was fortunate as we had a Kafka connector for ADX. Unfortunately, it is not a managed connector, so I cannot run it in Confluent Cloud - bummer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this post looks at the various options we have if we want to use the Kafka Connect Kusto Sink Connector connecting Confluent Cloud in Azure with Azure Data Explorer. However, if you are not interested in neither Kafka nor ADX, the post may still be of use for you. The reason being it also covers running Docker images in Azure Container Instances (ACI).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to Deploy the Debezium SQL Server Connector to Docker</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been doing a couple of conference talks lately (virtual, of course) about streaming data from SQL Server to Kafka. The title of the presentation is &lt;strong&gt;Free Your SQL Server Data With Kafka&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the presentation, I talk (and show) various ways of getting data from SQL Server to Kafka. One of the ways I cover is Microsoft CDC, together with Debezium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I do the presentation, I always have a SQL Server installed locally, and I run Kafka in Docker. Without fail, every time I set up the environment, I cannot remember how to deploy the Debezium SQL Server Connector into Docker. Therefore I decided to write this post to have something to go back to for next time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SQL Server 2019 for Linux in Docker on Windows</title>
      <link>https://nielsberglund.com/post/sql-server-2019-for-linux-in-docker-on-windows/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 29 Sep 2018 12:06:09 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nielsberglund.com/post/sql-server-2019-for-linux-in-docker-on-windows/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;By the time I publish this blog post 

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ignite&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;MS Ignite&lt;/a&gt; is over. During Ignite, Microsoft announced quite a few new things, amongst them &lt;strong&gt;SQL Server 2019&lt;/strong&gt; with a whole lot of new features and functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I touched briefly on some of them in my 

&lt;a href=&#34;https://nielsberglund.com/post/2018-09-24-sql-server-2019-public-preview/&#34;&gt;What is New in SQL Server 2019 Public Preview&lt;/a&gt; post. A couple of things that caught my eye were that &lt;strong&gt;SQL Server 2019 for Linux&lt;/strong&gt; now supports In-Database analytics, what we know as &lt;strong&gt;SQL Server Machine Learning Services&lt;/strong&gt; (R and Python), as well as the Java language extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; You may ask yourself what the Java language extension is; well, that is the ability to access Java code from T-SQL. It is a little bit like SQLCLR, but it executes outside of the SQL Server memory and process space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing that I never really have played around with &lt;em&gt;SQL Server for Linux&lt;/em&gt;, mostly due to that in previous versions (2017) it did not have support for In-Database analytics, I thought that now would be a good time to have a look.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
