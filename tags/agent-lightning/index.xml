      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week explores how AI agents are fundamentally transforming software development, from Hugging Face enabling Claude to orchestrate complete LLM fine-tuning workflows through natural language, to Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Agent Lightning adding reinforcement learning capabilities without code rewrites, and Every&amp;rsquo;s pioneering Compound Engineering methodology, where single developers now accomplish what once required entire teams.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We also examine GitHub&amp;rsquo;s research, revealing how developers are evolving from &amp;ldquo;code producers&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;creative directors of code,&amp;rdquo; the Model Context Protocol&amp;rsquo;s transition to the Linux Foundation, and practical tutorials on building procedural memory agents. Plus, a special celebration of our triumphant Data &amp;amp; AI Community Day Durban Year-End-Finale, where nearly 200 attendees gave exceptional ratings despite the festive season, now it&amp;rsquo;s time for well-deserved rest before 2026! 🎄&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Week 44, 2025, delivers a powerhouse lineup focused squarely on the evolving infrastructure of AI agents, from training to deployment, and everything in between. Microsoft Research&amp;rsquo;s Agent Lightning dominates the conversation with multiple deep dives exploring how reinforcement learning can finally make agents that actually learn from experience. At the same time, GitHub&amp;rsquo;s Agent HQ announcement promises to transform the platform into a unified orchestration layer for agents from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The week also brings critical perspectives on the scalability challenges of spec-driven development and two exceptional technical breakdowns of Claude&amp;rsquo;s Skills system; one exploring practical Neo4j integration and another delivering what might be the definitive reverse-engineered documentation of Skills&amp;rsquo; meta-tool architecture. Suppose you&amp;rsquo;re building with agents or trying to understand where this ecosystem is heading. In that case, this week&amp;rsquo;s roundup captures the exact moment when agent frameworks are maturing from experimental toys into production-ready infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
