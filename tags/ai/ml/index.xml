      <description>&lt;p&gt;You who read my blog are probably used to how the &amp;ldquo;Interesting Stuff&amp;rdquo; posts are published on a Sunday. This week, however, I am a bit late. I have been busy with other things (travelling) and have not had time to write this post until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, some of the &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo; I cover this week is Microsoft Fabric, some cool AI/ML and LLM (Large Language Model) things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is a very interesting article on the real-time streaming ecosystem by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/hkdulay/&#34;&gt;Hubert Dulay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week, I came across debugging Jupyter notebooks in VSCode. I learned about some amazing applications of generative AI for analytics, content creation, and natural language queries. I also explored how to train a machine-learning model on a Kafka stream using Python libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://sessionize.com/data-saturday-durban2023/&#34;&gt;CfS&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;Data Saturday Durban 2023&lt;/strong&gt; is still open, and we have already received quite a few submissions. If you are interested in attending, I suggest you &lt;a href=&#34;https://datasaturdays.com/2023-08-19-datasaturday0043/&#34;&gt;book your seat&lt;/a&gt; NOW, as there are a limited number of seats for this &lt;strong&gt;FREE&lt;/strong&gt; event, and the event promises to be awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in these topics, read further, and you see the links to the articles and resources that inspired me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this week&amp;rsquo;s blog post, I share some interesting links and insights on generative AI for analytics, Microsoft Fabric, and real-time streaming. You will see links about using natural language queries to access data in Amazon RDS using OpenAI and LangChain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to leverage Microsoft Fabric to simplify and enhance your data solutions with Power BI and other Azure products and how to use Kusto Query Language and Kqlmagic in Fabric notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to compare and choose stream processing platforms for your use cases and detect and filter PII data from unstructured data streams using Confluent and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the full post for more details and examples.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some very exciting things this week: Generative AI may shift focus from technology-driven to product-driven development. A game analytics framework/solution to help game developers analyze players. How to use synthetic data in ML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to handle late-arriving events in Apache Flink. An introduction to materialized views and how they can help. Also, a plug for an upcoming post by me about how to build multi-platform Docker images.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s exciting stuff: cool video from an &lt;strong&gt;Azure Data Explorer&lt;/strong&gt; (ADX) workshop. Speaking of ADX, I published my third post in the series of building a real-time leaderboard using Kafka and ADX. On the AI/ML side, &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo; about building a GPT-powered application and a really interesting intro to reinforcement learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a roundup without something about Kafka. So, a link to a post about Kafka and fraud detection. Also, a link to the second post in the series about machine learning and streaming data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week it is mostly streaming related &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo; that has caught my eye. Regardless of that, we start with some Generative AI - or rather prompt engineering, where I link to a post around different types of &amp;ldquo;frameworks&amp;rdquo; for prompt engineering. When you read the post you will see why &amp;ldquo;frameworks&amp;rdquo; are in quotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From that we go into streaming &amp;ldquo;land&amp;rdquo; and look at stream processing vs. real-time OLAP databases. There&amp;rsquo;s an interesting article about building data lakes on AWS using open-source technologies. I round off the streaming with a post about Spark Structured Streaming and REST APIs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I came home from London a couple of days ago, and I can&amp;rsquo;t tell you how good it is to be back home!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among other things, what caught my eye for this week&amp;rsquo;s roundup was that Azure now offers a managed load testing service and the open-sourcing of LMOps: a collection of tools for improving text prompts used as input to generative AI models. Also interesting is vector search and what you can do with it. Finally, if you are interested in Kafka, there is an excellent introductory guide to Kafka.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I also discuss my experience with trying to run Flink SQL in Docker. In short, the Flink Docker experience could be better!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
