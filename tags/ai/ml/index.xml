      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this week&amp;rsquo;s post, I will share with you some of the most interesting and relevant articles I have read this week on various topics related to data and streaming. You will find links to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The latest research developments in reinforcement learning and how they can be applied to different domains and challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The real-time streaming ecosystem and how to design and implement a streaming solution using various tools and technologies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The performance and latency improvements of Apache Spark Structured Streaming and how they enable more use cases for real-time data processing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The highlights of Kafka Summit 2023, the largest conference for Apache Kafka users and enthusiasts, and the new features and announcements from Confluent, the leading provider of Kafka solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Saturday&lt;/strong&gt; in Johannesburg in August and planning for the upcoming &lt;strong&gt;Data Saturday - Durban&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are curious about these topics and want to stay updated on the latest trends and innovations in the data and streaming world, read on!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some very exciting things this week: Generative AI may shift focus from technology-driven to product-driven development. A game analytics framework/solution to help game developers analyze players. How to use synthetic data in ML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to handle late-arriving events in Apache Flink. An introduction to materialized views and how they can help. Also, a plug for an upcoming post by me about how to build multi-platform Docker images.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s exciting stuff: cool video from an &lt;strong&gt;Azure Data Explorer&lt;/strong&gt; (ADX) workshop. Speaking of ADX, I published my third post in the series of building a real-time leaderboard using Kafka and ADX. On the AI/ML side, &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo; about building a GPT-powered application and a really interesting intro to reinforcement learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a roundup without something about Kafka. So, a link to a post about Kafka and fraud detection. Also, a link to the second post in the series about machine learning and streaming data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week it is mostly streaming related &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo; that has caught my eye. Regardless of that, we start with some Generative AI - or rather prompt engineering, where I link to a post around different types of &amp;ldquo;frameworks&amp;rdquo; for prompt engineering. When you read the post you will see why &amp;ldquo;frameworks&amp;rdquo; are in quotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From that we go into streaming &amp;ldquo;land&amp;rdquo; and look at stream processing vs. real-time OLAP databases. There&amp;rsquo;s an interesting article about building data lakes on AWS using open-source technologies. I round off the streaming with a post about Spark Structured Streaming and REST APIs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I came home from London a couple of days ago, and I can&amp;rsquo;t tell you how good it is to be back home!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among other things, what caught my eye for this week&amp;rsquo;s roundup was that Azure now offers a managed load testing service and the open-sourcing of LMOps: a collection of tools for improving text prompts used as input to generative AI models. Also interesting is vector search and what you can do with it. Finally, if you are interested in Kafka, there is an excellent introductory guide to Kafka.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This weeks roundup includes links to articles and videos about using Azure OpenAI and deploying ML models with FastAPI and Azure, as well as a post about Change Data Capture and its patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also discuss my experience with trying to run Flink SQL in Docker. In short, the Flink Docker experience could be better!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI/data science&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;data in general&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;data architecture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;streaming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;distributed computing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SQL Server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;transactions (both db as well as non db)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and other &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
