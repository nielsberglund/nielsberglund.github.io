In a previous post I wrote about how I have started to play with F#. As that post also covered SQLCLR it was obvious I was on Windows. Even though I make my living from development in a Windows environment, my main machine is a MacBook, and I run OSX as my main OS. I have previously also been running Linux (ArchLinux) on this machine as my main OS. Naturally I have heard about Mono (and also installed it a couple of times - and quickly un-installed again, but I have not really done anything with it. I have always run Windows in a VM on my MacBook for development etc. However after the announcement that F# was going Open Source, and Tomas P posted about his F# MonoDevelop plug-in, I decided that I should have a look at what it would be like to do F# &ldquo;stuff in OSX.

    <p>This is a first post about my experiences with running F# and Mono on a Mac.</p>

<p>In a <a href="/2010/11/15/using-f#-in-sqlclr/">previous post</a> I wrote about how I have started to play with F#. As that post also covered SQLCLR it was obvious I was on Windows. Even though I make my living from development in a Windows environment, my main machine is a MacBook, and I run OSX as my main OS. I have previously also been running Linux (ArchLinux) on this machine as my main OS. Naturally I have heard about Mono (and also installed it a couple of times - and quickly un-installed again, but I have not really done anything with it. I have always run Windows in a VM on my MacBook for development etc. However after the announcement that F# was going <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dsyme/archive/2010/11/04/announcing-the-f-compiler-library-source-code-drop.aspx">Open Source</a>, and <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog">Tomas P</a> <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-in-monodevelop.aspx">posted</a> about his F# MonoDevelop plug-in</a>, I decided that I should have a look at what it would be like to do F# &ldquo;stuff in OSX.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This is what I did:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html">Downloaded Mono</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=f8c623ae-aef6-4a06-a185-05f59be47d67&amp;displaylang=en">Downloaded F#</a>. You want to download the zip file.</li>
</ol>

<p>Having downloaded what I thought was necessary (I decided to hold off with MonoDevelop until I had everything running), I started the installation process. Installing Mono was straight forward, just mount the <code>.dmg</code> and then run the <code>.pkg</code> file. The only slight issue after installation was where it had been installed. Mostly for my own reference for later installations; Mono is located at: <code>/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework</code>.</p>

<p>After I had installed Mono, I copied the bin directory from the unzipped F# file to a directory I created in the same root folder as where Mono was: <code>/Library/Frameworks/FSharp</code>. I copied the <code>install-mono.sh</code> file to the FSharp directory and was ready to start the installation. Fortunately before I executed the <code>install-mono.sh</code> file, I read the comments in the file. At this stage I realised I had not downloaded everything necessary.</p>

<p>One of the F# dll&rsquo;s <code>FSharp.Core.dll</code> needs to be installed in the gac. In order to do that, the dll needs to be re-signed with the <code>mono.snk</code> key. The installation file mentions how you can download the file using <code>wget</code>. As I did not have <code>wget</code> I found a link to it and downloaded it by right-clicking on the link and choose &ldquo;Save Link As&rdquo;. Once again mostly for my future reference; the file can be found <a href="http://github.com/mono/mono/raw/master/mcs/class/mono.snk">here</a>, (just right click and choose &ldquo;Save Link As&rdquo;). I saved it into the F# root folder (the same folder where the <code>install-mono.sh</code> is).</p>

<p>So, now everything should be ready to go. I executed the install file and promptly got an error saying that the <code>FSharp.Core.dll</code> could not be installed in the gac. Hmm, not good! Fortunately the error message mentioned something about a possible permission error, so I looked at the permissions on the gac folder (<code>../Mono.framework/Versions/2.8/lib/mono/gac</code>), and sure enough - I did not have write permissions. I gave myself write permissions, and re-ran the installation and everything went OK. Cool!!</p>

<p>After this it was time to test it out. From the F# bin directory I ran the following from a terminal window to execute the compiler: <code>mono fsc.exe</code>. It seemed to work as I got this error back:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/fsc.exe.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I then tried the interactive window: <code>mono fsi.exe</code>. I wrote some simple test code:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/fsi-exec.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you can see, that worked as well!! So I am now well on the way of running (and learning) F# on Mono. Next step is to install MonoDevelop and Tomas P&rsquo;s plugin for F#. Stay tuned&hellip;</p>
