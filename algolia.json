As the title implies, Kafka ingests data into \u003cstrong\u003eAzure Data Explorer\u003c/strong\u003e (ADX).

Historically analytics has been limited to a small set of users in an organization (think the C-suite, power users, etc.). User-facing analytics changes that and makes analytics available to the end-users. An example of \u0026ldquo;user-facing analytics\u0026rdquo; is LinkedIn\u0026rsquo;s: \u0026ldquo;Who\u0026rsquo;s viewed your profile\u0026rdquo;.

As you may know or not, I live in Durban, South Africa. Durban is in the province of KZN (KwaZulu-Natal), home to Jacob Zuma, ex-president of SA. On July 8, Jacob Zuma was put in jail after being found guilty of contempt of court. The jailing of Jacob Zuma led to protests that initially were peaceful. However, this changed Sunday, July 11, when small scale rioting broke out in and around Durban. On Monday (July 12), it escalated to full-scale rioting, looting, and factories burning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe police were not prepared for the scale of the riots and could not offer any form of protection and help, so the local communities took it upon themselves to protect the local areas. Roadblocks were put up to prevent rioters from entering the neighbourhoods. The roadblocks were manned 24/7 by people from the community, and we did nighttime patrols to show presence and act as a deterrent. So I have done night patrols from last Monday until Friday night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat we did seem to have helped, and fortunately we had no issues in the area I live in. I must say however, that it is a bit frightening when you are out in the middle of the night, and you hear gunshots some hundred meters away!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s enough of my \u0026ldquo;adventures\u0026rdquo;, let\u0026rsquo;s get back to what this post is all about.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":["SQL Server","Apache Spark","Azure Data Explorer","Kafka"],"title":"Interesting Stuff - Week 29, 2021","type":"post","url":"/post/2021-07-18-interesting-stuff---week-29-2021/","weight":0,"wordcount":577},{"author":null,"categories":["roundup"],"content":"Kafka \u0026 Apache Pinot @ Uber, SQL Server BDC CU11, SQLServerGeeks Magazine, and other interesting topics.","date":1625987259,"description":"Kafka \u0026 Apache Pinot @ Uber, SQL Server BDC CU11, SQLServerGeeks Magazine, and other interesting topics.","dir":"post\\","excerpt_html":"Kafka \u0026 Apache Pinot @ Uber, SQL Server BDC CU11, SQLServerGeeks Magazine, and other interesting topics.","excerpt_text":"Kafka \u0026 Apache Pinot @ Uber, SQL Server BDC CU11, SQLServerGeeks Magazine, and other interesting topics.","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":400,"html":"Kafka \u0026 Apache Pinot @ Uber, SQL Server BDC CU11, SQLServerGeeks Magazine, and other interesting topics.","keywords":["SQL Server Big Data Cluster","Apache Pinot","Kafka","Data Platform Summit","DataPlatformGeeks"],"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625987259,"objectID":"cc7dc1ab4d336a905e3b3409b69f84d1","permalink":"https://nielsberglund.com/post/2021-07-11-interesting-stuff---week-28-2021/","publishdate":"2021-07-11T09:07:39+02:00","readingtime":2,"relpermalink":"/post/2021-07-11-interesting-stuff---week-28-2021/","section":"post","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThroughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth that has to do with things that interest me:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAI/data science\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003edata in general\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003edata architecture\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003estreaming\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003edistributed computing\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSQL Server\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003etransactions (both db as well as non db)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eand other \u0026ldquo;stuff\u0026rdquo;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis blog-post is the \u0026ldquo;roundup\u0026rdquo;

Sure enough, when I tried to do the same on my \u0026ldquo;fixed\u0026rdquo; instance, I could not either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo in this post, I look at how to fix that second issue.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":["SQL Server 2019","Polybase"],"title":"More PolyBase Issues in SQL Server 2019 Developers Edition","type":"post","url":"/post/2019-12-30-more-polybase-issues-in-sql-server-2019-developers-edition/","weight":0,"wordcount":1769},{"author":null,"categories":["SQL Server 2019","SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster"],"content":"WE look at using Azure Data Studio to deploy SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster.","date":1577122536,"description":"WE look at using Azure Data Studio to deploy SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster.","dir":"post\\","excerpt_html":"WE look at using Azure Data Studio to deploy SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster.","excerpt_text":"WE look at using Azure Data Studio to deploy SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster.","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":3200,"html":"WE look at using Azure Data Studio to deploy SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster.","keywords":["SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster","Kubernetes","Azure Kubernetes Service","Azure Data Studio","Spark","Hadoop","Python"],"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577122536,"objectID":"10e1b476a7e09559e1fecb976a86b463","permalink":"https://nielsberglund.com/post/2019-12-23-how-to-deploy-sql-server-2019-big-data-cluster-using-azure-data-studio/","publishdate":"2019-12-23T19:35:36+02:00","readingtime":15,"relpermalink":"/post/2019-12-23-how-to-deploy-sql-server-2019-big-data-cluster-using-azure-data-studio/","section":"post","summary":"\u003cp\u003eFor you who follows my sporadic posts, you may wonder why I have yet another post, (YAP), covering how to deploy a \u003cstrong\u003eSQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster\u003c/strong\u003e, (BDC), using \u003cstrong\u003eAzure Data Studio\u003c/strong\u003e, (ADS).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer to that is that the version of BDC I deployed in \u003ca href=\"/post/2019-09-11-install-sql-server-2019-big-data-cluster-using-azure-data-studio/\"\u003ethis\u003c/a\u003e post was a pre-release, and since then BDC has gone GA, (General Availability), and there are certain differences in deployment process between RC1, and RTM.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo in this post let us look at how to deploy BDC RTM to Azure Kubernetes Service using ADS.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":["SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster","Kubernetes","Azure Kubernetes Service","Azure Data Studio","Spark","Hadoop","Python"],"title":"How to Deploy SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster Using Azure Data Studio","type":"post","url":"/post/2019-12-23-how-to-deploy-sql-server-2019-big-data-cluster-using-azure-data-studio/","weight":0,"wordcount":3150},{"author":null,"categories":["roundup"],"content":"Kafka, ksqlDB, Kubernetes, SQL Server 2019 on Linux, and other interesting topics!","date":1576387272,"description":"Kafka, ksqlDB, Kubernetes, SQL Server 2019 on Linux, and other interesting topics!","dir":"post\\","excerpt_html":"Kafka, ksqlDB, Kubernetes, SQL Server 2019 on Linux, and other interesting topics!","excerpt_text":"Kafka, ksqlDB, Kubernetes, SQL Server 2019 on Linux, and other interesting topics!","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":500,"html":"Kafka, ksqlDB, Kubernetes, SQL Server 2019 on Linux, and other interesting topics!","keywords":["distributed computing","SQL Server","SQL Server 2019","Kafka","Kubernetes","ksqlDB"],"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576387272,"objectID":"9d42ab2077025a6871b25e710b53eac2","permalink":"https://nielsberglund.com/post/2019-12-15-interesting-stuff---week-50--year-end-2019/","publishdate":"2019-12-15T07:21:12+02:00","readingtime":2,"relpermalink":"/post/2019-12-15-interesting-stuff---week-50--year-end-2019/","section":"post","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThroughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth, that has to do with things that interest me:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003edata science\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003edata in general\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003edistributed computing\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSQL Server\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003etransactions (both db as well as non db)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eand other \u0026ldquo;stuff\u0026rdquo;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis blog-post is the \u0026ldquo;roundup\u0026rdquo;

Ever since I started programming, SQL Server has been my \u0026ldquo;trusty companion\u0026rdquo;, and my belief is that if you don\u0026rsquo;t have SQL Server as a backend, then there is something wrong. At work, (\u003ca href=\"/derivco\"\u003eDerivco\u003c/a\u003e), it is the same thing, and we are jokingly saying that we do not have business logic in the database, we have full-blown applications!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, both me personally and at work, we do realise the value of streaming data; for real-time processing as well as to distribute data without having to rely on replication. In the ideal world, we would change the applications/systems that are the source of the data to both publish the data as event streams as well as persisting the data to the database. However, it may not be possible to change those applications/systems - at least not in the time frame we would like.

The consequence of this is that when we execute Java code, we need to indicate where the compiled code resides, and those locations need specific permissions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll this creates a level of complexity, and it would potentially be easier if we load the Java code from a well-known place, where we do not need to worry about permissions and so forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis post is the first of a couple where we see how new functionality in SQL Server 2019 CTP 2.3 can help.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":["SQL Server 2019","R","Python","Java","SQL Server Extensibility Framework","CREATE EXTERNAL LIBRARY"],"title":"SQL Server 2019, Java \u0026 External Libraries - I","type":"post","url":"/post/2019-03-10-sql-server-2019-java--external-libraries---i/","weight":0,"wordcount":2002},{"author":null,"categories":["roundup"],"content":"Kafka, Flink, SQL Server 2019 CTP2.3, and other interesting topics.","date":1551603261,"description":"Kafka, Flink, SQL Server 2019 CTP2.3, and other interesting topics.","dir":"post\\","excerpt_html":"Kafka, Flink, SQL Server 2019 CTP2.3, and other interesting topics.","excerpt_text":"Kafka, Flink, SQL Server 2019 CTP2.3, and other interesting topics.","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":400,"html":"Kafka, Flink, SQL Server 2019 CTP2.3, and other interesting topics.","keywords":["data science","distributed computing","SQL Server 2019","Kafka","Flink"],"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551603261,"objectID":"5bb75909cd458dc625b58c8ce5435c66","permalink":"https://nielsberglund.com/post/2019-03-03-interesting-stuff---week-9-2019/","publishdate":"2019-03-03T10:54:21+02:00","readingtime":2,"relpermalink":"/post/2019-03-03-interesting-stuff---week-9-2019/","section":"post","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThroughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth, that has to do with things that interest me:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003edata science\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003edata in general\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003edistributed computing\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSQL Server\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003etransactions (both db as well as non db)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eand other \u0026ldquo;stuff\u0026rdquo;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis blog-post is the \u0026ldquo;roundup\u0026rdquo;

I wrote about how Microsoft has changed the relation between CAS and security boundaries, and CAS is no longer supported as a boundary! And also how Microsoft introduced an \u003ccode\u003esp_configure\u003c/code\u003e option called \u003ccode\u003eclr strict security\u003c/code\u003e, which by default is set to 1 (on). When the setting is on, SQL Server treats all assemblies (\u003ccode\u003eSAFE\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003eEXTERNAL_ACCESS\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003eUNSAFE\u003c/code\u003e) as if they were marked \u003ccode\u003eUNSAFE\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe release I wrote the post against was CTP 2.1, and earlier this week Microsoft released SQL Server 2017 RC1.
